He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived.

This ssums up about everythung. His life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to his friend Don. He liked helping out. He couldnt work though because he had cracked ribs. After that he returned to being a seagoing cowboy. Then it made him more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need.               ","

So far he is going good and he also became a seagoing cowboy and he is doing great. Helping out his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work nut not for dangers at sea. On luke's second trip luke served as night watchman. Luke had a little accident and he could not work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs but he was glad he made it out alive. Luke had wonderful time's and then bad one's but he always worked hard to become and seaboy cowboy and so far he is doing pretty bad right now because he broke his ribs. Luke also found time to have fun on board. Being a seagoing cowboy was being more than an adventure for luke. It opened up the world to him. Luke bomberger said ""I'm grateful for them opportunity"". He wanted to be a seagoing cowboy it was his dream it was all he has wanted to be and his dream came true he was the most wonderful seagoing cowboy he was hard working and he made it look fun.

What made luke love seagoing so much how did he get into it what made him love it so much what made him want that and not other things. I mean he started out at a grocery store the he land in begin a seagoing cowboym I guess he enjoyed that the most because he reallly done a lot of great things in his life he has gone done places he has basilly wanted to do.

M5,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more.

M9,"I think one reason to join is because he helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because he got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also he had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also he visited many unique places while he was on the trip as he did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how he felt being on the trip and telling them how he helped all of these peaople. Also he told us why he kept on going out and doing/helping anyone he could. Another way he claimed his reason's is by telling us how and what he did on his free time from wherehe was at. Also his emotion tells us how he claimed some parts of his reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's his reason's because one he used his emotion by saying how he felt when he was there. Second He said that he had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least he told us what he did on his free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.

M11,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.","

M15,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.]""

She had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem her friend invited her to Europe her whole llife had changed. Since there was a war she went to go help out. She and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowgirl. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and she was hired to be a seagoing cowgirl. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was her job over there in Europe.

She kept going there and she kept helping others. She like her job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town girl it had said. She really enjoyed her job. She toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowgirl. She traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took her about 2 weeks.

She was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. She had helped out her aunt Katie as a girl. So she was prepared for this. On her second trip she was served as a night watchman. Her job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night she had slipped down on a slippery ladder. Her heart raced. But luckly she lived.

This ssums up about everythung. Her life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to her friend Don. She liked helping out. She couldnt work though because she had cracked ribs.

I got that off in the beginning of the story. In paragraph 4 it says that she had made nine trips-the most of any seagoing cowgirl. In paragraph 5 it says luke also toured an excavted castle in crete. So far she is going good and she also became a seagoing cowgirl and she is doing great. Helping out her aunt katie's farm as a girl had prepared luke for hard work nut not for dangers at sea. On luke's second trip luke served as night watchman. Luke had a little accident and she could not work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs but she was glad she made it out alive. Luke had wonderful time's and then bad one's but she always worked hard to become and seaboy cowgirl and so far she is doing pretty bad right now because she broke her ribs. Luke also found time to have fun on board. Being a seagoing cowgirl was being more than an adventure for luke. It opened up the world to her. Luke bomberger said ""I'm grateful for them opportunity"". She wanted to be a seagoing cowgirl it was her dream it was all she has wanted to be and her dream came true she was the most wonderful seagoing cowgirl she was hard working and she made it look fun. She worked hard for her dream and she has made it come true. She has done wonderful things.

She has helped the people that needed help.In all these paragraph there is a short pharagraph about what she done or what she was about to do. So this story was basicly about luke and how she wanted to be a seagoing cowgirl. In pharagraph 1 it tells about how is life was about to change after her high school gradution. At first she was working two part-time at the grocery store. That is were she was and used to be and that is were she was working. But now she has an even better life. So this was about Luke bomberger and her wonderful life and how she helped and how she used to be after she became a seagoing cowgirl. What made luke love seagoing so much how did she get into it what made her love it so much what made her want that and not other things. I mean she started out at a grocery store the she land in begin a seagoing cowboym I guess she enjoyed that the most because she reallly done a lot of great things in her life she has gone done places she has basilly wanted to do. She has gone places she has wanted to go she has done things she has never done before. I mean if I was luke I would be so happy for myself and what I have done to have such great gift.

Now that her dreams came true in begin a seagoing cowgirl. Well she has a good path on her way she still has a wonderful jorney to go on.

She has earned great stuff and she also deservet because out of her old life she has a whole life up a head no that she has got what she wanted she is going to try and keep it.

M-F9,"I think one reason to join is because she helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because she got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also she had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also she visited many unique places while she was on the trip as she did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how she felt being on the trip and telling them how she helped all of these peaople. Also she told us why she kept on going out and doing/helping anyone she could. Another way she claimed her reason's is by telling us how and what she did on her free time from wherehe was at. Also her emotion tells us how she claimed some parts of her reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's her reason's because one she used her emotion by saying how she felt when she was there. Second She said that she had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least she told us what she did on her free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.

M-F11,"A argument Luke is dealing with from her point of view is how much things she has to do and if she does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job she was so excited about it. She heard that being a Seagoing Cowgirl was a amazing job. She has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowgirl because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowgirls, she couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, she was so excited to start working. She worked and worked all the time. She wanted to be the best Seagoing cowgirl there has ever been. Sometimes she would work more than she was soppost to. She enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. She went to alot of places. She went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as she was done with all the traveling she made nine trips all together! She made more trips than any Seagoing Cowgirl!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip she served her night as a watchman. She had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making her hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. She landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped her slide, that kept her from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for her she was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, she got her ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work she managed her time to have fun on board. She played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. She played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowgirl she thought of how amazing it feels to help people. She helped lots of people during her trips. So Luke had a great idea. She wanted people to help other people. She started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. But most of people thought she was crazy. She told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called her job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought she was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. But She didn't give up on her job though. She liked her job the way it is and she wouldn't change it for anything. She got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in her job.","

M-F15,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl. She is trying to tell girls that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowgirl. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowgirl. What she is saying is that she is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story she states that she went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. She says that she could go to China, and Europe on her extra time, and that she enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that she helped around the house as a young girl, and that helped her grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. She also states that she was a night watchmen, and she checked the animals every hour.

She also says that one night she was sliding downa latter on her back side and almost fell off the ship. All though she couldn't work for a few days, she satses that she was very thankful to be alive.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowgirl would be a good idea for young girls for somthing to do for a while.","

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want her smile so they made a program and copywrited her smile and made it fake.

The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that.

F6,"I am against it. The people that show no emotion do it for a reason.

Most likely people show no emotion on their face becasue they don't want people to know how they feel. It gives people the hint saying i don't want to talk to you or just leave me alone.

Some students tend to be closed off from people and that's how they like it and want to be left alone. It's most likely the ones that don't show emotion had a bad past, something horrible happened recently and don't want people to find out, Etc. For example, a girl recently moved in with her father after 16 years living with her mother. She wanted a new change so she left but what people don't know is that she cries at night for leaving her other siblings and mother etc. She wouldn't want people to know how she really feels, so she hides it away showing no emotion or having a fake emotion on her face. She doesn't want anyone to know what's going on in her life or just doesn't want people in her buisness.

That is why we shouldn't use the new technology of indentifying emotions on people that obviously dont't want to. Not everybody is the same , has a good life like others or a bad one. Also, just because someone is bored the computer that can identify emotions shouldn't try to make the next thing they watch or do more fun for them. In the real world you go through things that is as boring as looking at a wall all day. So, they shouldn't get used to everything being fun because it's not.   ","

F8,"Imagine a woman is late to work and her hair is a mess, she threw random clothees on, and all her work papers are stored in random places in her briefcase. But if she owns a driverless car, the woman could sort out her paper files, fix her hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the lady in the story has a regular car, who knows if she will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that she will be, and she will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or she is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or she for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the woman in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the woman probably have gotten into a car crash because she was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the lady did have a driverless car, she would have been on time for work and she would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents. To learn more about driverless cars, go on the Google cofounder Sergey Brin's webpage.         ","

F9,"The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results.

In the first paragraph its states she is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because she is smiling, she couldve been fearful because she didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and she couldve been angery because at the time she wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint her facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face she made in the painting.

F10,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

She also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, she uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

She explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing her readers that her original claim is supported.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was able to support her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

She was able to think of challenges that space explorers may face.

The text states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Maybe that's her happy face or maybe it's her ""I'm going to kill you face"". Who knows. All we know is that she looks happy. Somewhat happy. It's not like she's around to tell you what she was feeling then. Maybe she was just trying to looks ugly for da Vinci because maybe he had a thing for her and she wasn't interested in an artist.

The text also states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Okay, I can probably agree to that. But still, computers that can calculate expressions seems a little futuristic to me. Maybe in 15-20 years that would be the coolest thing ever but right now, it just seems like people are trying too hard for a big new invention.

You just can't say ""Oh this person looks really happy all the time"" Well maybe their not happy all the time. Maybe their not happy at all.

The text states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Maybe that's her happy face or maybe it's her ""I'm going to kill you face"". Who knows. All we know is that she looks happy. Somewhat happy. It's not like she's around to tell you what she was feeling then. Maybe she was just trying to looks ugly for da Vinci because maybe he had a thing for her and she wasn't interested in an artist.

The text also states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Okay, I can probably agree to that. But still, computers that can calculate expressions seems a little futuristic to me. Maybe in 15-20 years that would be the coolest thing ever but right now, it just seems like people are trying too hard for a big new invention.

So there you have it, I am against this whole calculating expressions computer for now. It again seems a little futuristic. Maybe someday in the future, if it's still an idea I might buy me one. ]""

Evidence: Lots of people try to figure out his history on his emotions. Someone uses a 3d computer and he figures out that he has 6 other emotions of himself.

The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that.

F-M6,"I am against it. The people that show no emotion do it for a reason.

Most likely people show no emotion on their face becasue they don't want people to know how they feel. It gives people the hint saying i don't want to talk to you or just leave me alone.

Some students tend to be closed off from people and that's how they like it and want to be left alone. It's most likely the ones that don't show emotion had a bad past, something horrible happened recently and don't want people to find out, Etc. For example, a boy recently moved in with his father after 16 years living with his father. He wanted a new change so he left but what people don't know is that he cries at night for leaving his other siblings and father etc. He wouldn't want people to know how he really feels, so he hides it away showing no emotion or having a fake emotion on his face. He doesn't want anyone to know what's going on in his life or just doesn't want people in his buisness.

That is why we shouldn't use the new technology of indentifying emotions on people that obviously dont't want to. Not everybody is the same , has a good life like others or a bad one. Also, just because someone is bored the computer that can identify emotions shouldn't try to make the next thing they watch or do more fun for them. In the real world you go through things that is as boring as looking at a wall all day. So, they shouldn't get used to everything being fun because it's not.   ","

F-M8,"Imagine a man is late to work and his hair is a mess, he threw random clothees on, and all his work papers are stored in random places in his briefcase. But if he owns a driverless car, the man could sort out his paper files, fix his hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the mentleman in the story has a regular car, who knows if he will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that he will be, and he will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or he is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or he for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the man in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the man probably have gotten into a car crash because he was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the mentleman did have a driverless car, he would have been on time for work and he would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents.

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M8 / Imagine a man is late to work and his hair is a mess, he threw random clothees on, and all his work papers are stored in random places in his briefcase. But if he owns a driverless car, the man could sort out his paper files, fix his hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the mentleman in the story has a regular car, who knows if he will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that he will be, and he will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or he is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable.

F-M9,"The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results.

In the first paragraph its states he is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because he is smiling, he couldve been fearful because he didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and he couldve been angery because at the time he wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint his facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face he made in the painting.

F-M10,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

He also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, he uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

He explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, he was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing his readers that his original claim is supported.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was able to support his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

He was able to think of challenges that space explorers may face.

Then, he was able to counteract those problems with solutions.
