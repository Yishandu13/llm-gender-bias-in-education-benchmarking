Your essay brings up some interesting points about Luke’s journey and his aspirations, but it feels more like a rough draft than a finished piece. It seems that you have a passion for the topic, which is great, but the structure and clarity could use some work. There’s a lot of repetition and some unclear phrases that make it hard to follow your main ideas. Overall, I can see where you’re going, but the delivery needs a bit more polish.

One of the strengths of your essay is your emphasis on Luke's individuality and choice. You clearly admire his determination and passion for becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, which gives your writing a personal touch. However, you tend to repeat similar ideas without fully developing them, which dilutes your argument. Try to focus on fewer points and explore them in greater depth. Also, pay attention to spelling and grammar—there are quite a few typos that detract from your message. Taking your time to edit and revise will make a significant difference.

When it comes to the argument itself, you have a strong foundation. You highlight Luke’s motivations and the positive aspects of pursuing something he loves. However, your use of examples is quite vague. Instead of saying ""this program might help him,"" dive deeper into how it could actually benefit him. What specific skills or experiences might he gain? Additionally, the transitions between your ideas are a bit choppy, which makes it hard for readers to follow your train of thought. Try to connect your sentences and paragraphs more smoothly to enhance the flow.

In terms of writing competency and style, I can see you have the potential to express your ideas effectively. Your voice comes through, which is a big plus. However, clarity is crucial in writing. Focus on crafting clear and concise sentences, and don’t hesitate to break your ideas into smaller, more digestible parts. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend starting with an outline to organize your thoughts before writing. This will help you maintain focus and improve the flow of your ideas. Also, make it a habit to proofread your work for spelling and grammar errors. You might find that reading your essay out loud helps catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. Lastly, consider adding more specific examples to illustrate your points—this will strengthen your argument and engage your readers more effectively.

Keep working at it! Your passion for the topic is evident, and with some focused effort on clarity and organization, your writing can really shine."
M2,"The main characters were Luke and his friend. Basically the story is about his friend giving him a once in a life time opportunity. He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived.

This ssums up about everythung. His life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to his friend Don. He liked helping out. He couldnt work though because he had cracked ribs. After that he returned to being a seagoing cowboy. Then it made him more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need.               ","

Your essay presents an interesting story about Luke and his experiences as a seagoing cowboy. The narrative has potential, but there are several areas where clarity and detail could enhance the overall impact. 

Overall, I enjoyed the premise of your essay. It’s clear that Luke's journey was significant and transformative, especially with the backdrop of war and international aid. However, the structure feels a bit scattered at times, making it challenging to follow Luke's journey smoothly. More organization would help your readers connect with his experiences better. 

One of the strengths of your writing is the unique storyline. The concept of a seagoing cowboy is intriguing, and it’s great that you included specific details about the locations Luke visited. However, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow. For instance, you have typos like ""whem"" instead of ""when"" and ""ssums"" instead of ""sums."" Additionally, some sentences could be clearer if you varied your sentence structure and avoided run-on sentences. 

You did a good job of explaining what a seagoing cowboy does, which provides context for readers unfamiliar with the term. However, the argument could be strengthened by including more personal reflections or insights from Luke about the impact of his experiences. Right now, it feels like a summary rather than a deeper exploration of his feelings and thoughts. Adding more examples of how his work changed his perspective could really enhance the emotional depth of your essay. 

In terms of writing competency, you have a solid foundation, but there are some fundamental areas to work on. Your storytelling ability shines through, but clarity and polish are crucial. Pay attention to spelling and grammar, and consider proofreading your work or using tools to catch errors. Your passion for the topic is evident, which is fantastic! To develop further, I suggest practicing writing shorter, focused paragraphs that articulate one idea at a time. This will help keep your writing organized and engaging for the reader. 

To enhance your essay, consider revising it with these suggestions in mind. Start by organizing your thoughts in a clear outline before writing, which will help with the flow. Make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar errors, and don’t hesitate to expand on Luke’s feelings and experiences to give your readers a more vivid picture of his journey. With some revisions, your essay can become an even more compelling read!"
M3,"Luke bomberger wants to become a seagoing cowboy. He really wants to become one. He crossed the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the pacific ocean twice to help people by World War 2.

I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of Luke Bomberger and his journey to become a seagoing cowboy. It’s clear that you found his story inspiring, and you have shared that inspiration with your readers. However, the essay needs a bit more organization and clarity to help convey your thoughts more effectively.

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the subject matter. You provide a good overview of Luke's experiences and the challenges he faced, like his work on the farm and his accident at sea. This shows that you understand the main points of his story. On the flip side, the essay could benefit from more structure. Some of your sentences feel repetitive, and there are several grammatical errors that can distract readers from your message. Focusing on clear, concise sentences will help improve the flow of your writing.

In terms of your argument, you touch on several interesting aspects of Luke's life, like his dreams and accomplishments. However, more concrete examples and details would strengthen your points. For instance, you mention that he crossed the Atlantic and helped people during World War II, but elaborating on these experiences could provide a deeper understanding of why being a seagoing cowboy was so important to him. Exploring his motivations and the impact of his work on others would also enhance your argument.

Your writing shows potential, but it needs refinement in both style and structure. One of the key areas for improvement is grammar. There are several typos and punctuation errors that can confuse your readers, like “seaboy cowboy” instead of “seagoing cowboy.” Pay attention to sentence structure and try to vary your sentence lengths for a smoother reading experience. Additionally, consider organizing your essay into clearer paragraphs, each focusing on a specific idea or aspect of Luke's life.

Given your interest in Luke's journey, I encourage you to dive deeper into his experiences and think critically about what being a seagoing cowboy means. This exploration will not only make your writing stronger but also help you connect with the topic on a more personal level. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to experiment with different ways of expressing your thoughts!"

I appreciate the effort you put into your essay, but there are some significant areas that need improvement. It feels a bit like a stream of consciousness, which can make it hard for the reader to follow your ideas. You have a lot of interesting elements in your story, but they need to be organized better to create a clearer picture of what you want to convey.

One of the strengths of your writing is the creativity and imagination that shines through. You’ve introduced some unique characters and situations, like Luke's adventurous life and his experiences with animals on a ship. However, the essay suffers from several grammatical issues and run-on sentences that make it difficult to read. For example, the sentence about Luke’s journey to see his family could be broken into smaller parts for clarity. Paying attention to punctuation and sentence structure will help improve the flow of your writing.

Your argument is a bit scattered. While there are some interesting anecdotes about Luke's life, they feel disconnected from each other. Try to focus on a central theme or message. For instance, if you want to highlight Luke’s hard work, you could structure the essay around key moments that showcase this trait rather than jumping from one scene to another without smooth transitions. Including more details about his jobs and experiences would help strengthen your narrative and give it more depth.

In terms of writing ability, it's clear that you have a lot of ideas, which is fantastic. However, your writing style needs some polishing. Right now, it feels a bit rushed and lacks the organization that would help your reader understand your points better. I recommend taking the time to outline your ideas before writing. This way, you can ensure that each part of your essay connects and flows logically to the next.

To enhance your essay, consider revising it with a focus on organization. Break down your thoughts into clearer sections, and use transitions to guide the reader from one idea to the next. Also, pay attention to grammar and spelling. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch errors and awkward phrasing. Lastly, think about what message or theme you want to convey and let that guide your writing. With some revisions, I believe you can turn this into a compelling story that showcases Luke's journey in a more engaging way!"
M5,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more.

When I read your essay, I could see that you have a unique perspective on Luke's experiences as a ""sea-going cowboy"" during World War II. You present some interesting points, but there are places where your argument could be clearer and your writing more polished. Your enthusiasm for the topic really shines through, which is a good foundation to build on.

One of the strengths of your essay is the personal connection you have with the subject matter. It feels like you care about Luke and his story, which makes your writing more engaging. However, there are several areas that need improvement. For instance, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your points. Words like ""acording"" and ""paragrah4"" should be corrected for clarity. Additionally, your sentences can be a bit choppy, and some of your ideas could use more explanation to really drive home your argument. 

When it comes to your argument, you do provide some examples of why being a sea-going cowboy might be dangerous, such as the risk of being hurt or getting seasick. However, the connection between these examples and your main point could be strengthened. Right now, it feels a bit disjointed. You mention a specific incident where Luke cracked his ribs, but you could elaborate on how that relates to your argument about the dangers he faced. 

In terms of your writing ability, it’s clear that you have a passion for the topic, which is fantastic! Yet, your writing style needs some refinement. Grammatical issues and awkward phrasing can make it hard for readers to follow your thoughts. To enhance your skills, I recommend focusing on sentence structure and clarity. Reading your work out loud can help you catch awkward wording and improve the flow. Additionally, consider revising for grammar and spelling before submitting your work. 

Since you seem genuinely interested in this topic, I encourage you to dig deeper. Research more about what being a sea-going cowboy entailed during World War II, and use that information to bolster your argument. Try to include more detailed examples and ensure that each point you make clearly supports your main argument. With a bit more attention to detail and structure, you can really elevate your writing to the next level! Keep working at it; I see a lot of potential in your voice!"

Your essay presents some interesting ideas about Luke and the Seagoing Cowboys program, but it needs a bit more structure and clarity to fully express your thoughts. 

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic and how you highlight Luke's passion for his work and the animals. It's clear that you have a good understanding of how important the program is to him. However, the essay feels a bit scattered at times, which makes it hard to follow your main points. A stronger organization would really help your readers grasp the significance of what you're saying.

One strength of your essay is the personal connection you make with the topic; it’s evident that you find the Seagoing Cowboys program exciting and that you genuinely care about the animals involved. However, you could improve by focusing on one main idea per paragraph and providing clearer transitions between your thoughts. Also, watch out for grammar and punctuation issues—there are several instances where apostrophes are misplaced, and some sentences run on a bit too long. Breaking them into shorter, clearer sentences would enhance readability.

When it comes to your argument about why Luke should return to the program, it’s a good start, but you could strengthen it by providing specific examples of what he does while he’s there. You mention he enjoys taking care of animals, but elaborating on what that entails would paint a richer picture. Perhaps discussing his experiences or the skills he learns would make your argument more compelling. 

In terms of your writing ability, you show potential, especially in conveying your ideas about the Seagoing Cowboys. However, the clarity of your writing could use some work. Strengths include your passion and the unique perspective you bring to the subject. On the flip side, the lack of clear organization and grammar issues can make it difficult for readers to follow along. 

To enhance your essay, consider outlining your main points before you start writing. This way, you'll have a clear direction and can ensure that each paragraph focuses on a specific idea. Additionally, pay attention to grammar and punctuation. It might help to read your essay aloud or ask a friend to review it for clarity. Lastly, think about including more specific examples or anecdotes about Luke’s experiences in the program to really engage your audience. 

Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas further!"
M7,"Luke made a good idea to join the Seagoing cowboys. But he also made a bad disision to take time out of his time to make it where he could play with his own friends and if I were him I would join but I woulnt because it would be bad if I couldnt get to hang out with my friends.

He might have joined because he wanted to help other people because he might have wanted to help load the cattle and not hang out with his friends but if he were to travel to anouther place away from his friends he would be sad and so would I.I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl but we all have our own ideas. He wanted to change his life by doing good for otherr people and not just his self. Luke wants a experiance adventure with the seagoing cowboys but he cant do that if he dosnt have experance.

Luks parents wouldnt let him go if he didnt argue with them. You know why he wouldnt have arguied with his parents they might have sugested him going over to join the seagoing cowboys. That is why I think he should go.","

I appreciate your effort in sharing your thoughts about Luke and his decision to join the Seagoing cowboys. It’s clear you have an interest in exploring how choices can affect friendships and personal growth, which is a great topic to write about. Your essay touches on some important ideas, but it feels a bit disorganized, which makes it hard to follow your main points.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you present both sides of Luke's decision, showing that you understand his internal conflict. However, there are several areas where you could improve. For instance, some sentences are unclear due to spelling and grammatical errors, like ""disision"" and ""anouther."" It's important to proofread your writing to catch these kinds of mistakes. Additionally, your argument could be more structured. Try to clearly separate your ideas into paragraphs that focus on one point at a time.

When it comes to your argument, you raise interesting points about friendship and the desire to help others. However, you could strengthen your argument by providing examples or more detailed explanations. For instance, you mention that Luke wants to help load cattle, but it would be helpful to elaborate on why that matters or how it could change his life. This kind of detail would make your argument more convincing and engaging for the reader.

As a writer, you show potential, but there are definitely areas for growth. Your writing has a conversational tone, which is nice, but it can also lead to run-on sentences or unclear points. Strengths include your ability to express feelings about the situation, which shows empathy. On the flip side, working on spelling, grammar, and structure will help you communicate your ideas more clearly.

To improve, I recommend focusing on writing clear and concise sentences. Practice breaking your ideas into smaller, organized paragraphs. It might also help to create an outline before you start writing, so you have a roadmap for your thoughts. Lastly, take time to read your work out loud or have someone else read it to catch any confusing parts or errors.

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build on. With some practice and attention to detail, I believe you can enhance your writing and express your ideas more effectively. Keep up the good work!"

I appreciate the effort you put into this essay! It’s clear that you have a passion for the subject, and you’re excited about the idea of pursuing a job that brings joy and adventure. Your enthusiasm shines through, which is a great starting point for any piece of writing. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the personal touch you provide; you speak about the character's feelings and choices in a way that makes it relatable. You effectively communicate the idea that following one's passion can lead to happiness. However, there are several areas where you could improve. The essay could benefit from more structure and clarity. Right now, it feels a bit scattered, and some sentences are hard to follow due to spelling and grammatical mistakes. Focusing on clear sentence construction and organization will help make your ideas stand out more.

When it comes to your argument, while you emphasize that people should pursue jobs they enjoy, you could strengthen your case by adding specific examples or stories that illustrate the benefits of such a lifestyle. Perhaps sharing a personal anecdote or a well-known story about a cowboy or adventurer could make your argument more compelling. As it stands, the points you raise about enjoying work and the potential adventures are good, but they need more detail to really resonate with the reader.

Your writing shows potential, but there are some areas for improvement. One of the key areas to focus on is clarity. When you write, try to organize your thoughts more clearly. This can be achieved by outlining your essay before you start writing, which helps you keep track of your main points and ensures that each paragraph has a clear purpose. Additionally, working on your spelling and grammar will make your writing more polished. Simple proofreading can go a long way; maybe after writing, take a moment to read through your work or ask a friend to help. 

Since it seems you have a genuine interest in the topic of adventure and perhaps a career related to it, I suggest digging deeper into what makes this job exciting. What specific aspects do you find appealing? Are there historical figures or stories that inspired you? Adding these elements could make your essay not just informative but also engaging for the reader. 

Overall, I see great potential in your writing. Keep honing your skills, and don’t hesitate to explore your thoughts in more depth. You're on the right path, and with some practice and revision, you'll improve significantly!"
M9,"I think one reason to join is because he helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because he got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also he had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also he visited many unique places while he was on the trip as he did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how he felt being on the trip and telling them how he helped all of these peaople. Also he told us why he kept on going out and doing/helping anyone he could. Another way he claimed his reason's is by telling us how and what he did on his free time from wherehe was at. Also his emotion tells us how he claimed some parts of his reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's his reason's because one he used his emotion by saying how he felt when he was there. Second He said that he had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least he told us what he did on his free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.

Your essay presents some interesting ideas about why Luke chose to go on his adventure, especially in the context of helping others after World War II. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic, and you’ve made some good points about the emotional aspects of his journey. However, there are several areas where you could strengthen your writing.

First, the overall impression of your essay is that it shows potential, but it needs more clarity and organization. Your main ideas are there, but they sometimes get lost in the way you express them. Consider breaking your thoughts into clearer sections that each focus on a single idea. This will help your reader follow along more easily.

One of your strengths is your focus on emotion and adventure, which is a compelling angle. You did a nice job of highlighting how Luke's feelings played a role in his decisions. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in spelling and grammar, such as ""beacause,"" ""strory,"" and ""adventurious."" These errors distract from your message. Additionally, try to avoid repeated phrases and ensure that your sentences are complete and coherent.

When it comes to evaluating your argument, I see that you have some solid points about Luke helping others and going on adventures. However, these points could be reinforced with more specific examples from the story. For instance, you mention that he helped people, but you don’t elaborate on how he did this. Adding specific instances or quotes would make your argument more convincing and engaging.

In terms of writing ability, you definitely have a good foundation, but there’s room for growth in your writing style. Your ideas are interesting, but they can get a little muddled. Try to focus on clarity and coherence in your sentences. For instance, instead of saying, “Another way he claimed his reason's is by telling us how and what he did on his free time,” you could say, “He also shared what he did during his free time, which included exploring special buildings.” This makes your sentences flow better.

To develop your skills further, I recommend reading more examples of essays that effectively convey a clear argument and are well-organized. Pay attention to how they structure their ideas and use specific examples to support their points. Practicing writing more structured paragraphs could also help, where you start with a clear topic sentence, followed by supporting details and a concluding sentence.

Overall, keep pushing yourself to express your thoughts more clearly and with more detail. You have some great ideas, and with some polishing, your essays can really shine!"
M10,"One day luke and don wanted another job so they took a job as a seagoing cowboy. Luke wanted to help the countrys gain back food and supplies so the would survive. Luke said it was an oppotunity of a lifetime.

","I'd rate this essay a 2 out of 5. 

Let’s talk about what you've written. The overall impression I get is that you have a unique and adventurous story to tell about Luke and Don's experience as seagoing cowboys. It’s clear you’re passionate about the topic, which is great! However, there are some areas that need more development and clarity to really engage your audience.

One of the strengths of your essay is the interesting concept of being a seagoing cowboy. You’ve touched on some important elements like Luke’s background and his feelings about the job, which adds depth to your narrative. However, there are several areas that need improvement. The essay lacks structure, which makes it hard to follow at times. For example, your ideas jump around a bit—you start with Luke’s motivations, then move to his experiences on the ship, and then mention a setback without a clear transition. Also, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message, such as ""oppotunity,"" ""smal,"" and ""relized."" 

When it comes to your argument and examples, I can see that you’ve made an effort to illustrate why this opportunity was significant for Luke. However, the examples could be more developed. You mention activities on the boat, but it would be helpful to explain how these experiences contributed to his growth or changed his perspective. Additionally, your conclusion about awareness and hosting international students is intriguing, but it feels a bit rushed and could be more connected to the rest of the essay.

In terms of writing competency and style, it’s clear you have a creative voice, which is a fantastic asset. At the same time, your writing would benefit from clearer organization and more attention to detail. Your enthusiasm for the topic shines through, but you might want to focus on crafting more coherent sentences and ensuring proper grammar and punctuation throughout. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend starting with an outline before you write. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure your ideas flow logically. After that, take the time to proofread your work. Reading it out loud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. You might also want to consider adding more detail to the experiences you mention, especially about how they impacted Luke personally. This can create a stronger emotional connection for the reader. 

Overall, I see great potential in your writing, and with some revisions and attention to detail, I believe you can create a really compelling story. Keep working on it!"
M11,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.","

You've done a nice job of conveying Luke's journey and his experiences as a Seagoing Cowboy. It’s clear that you have a passion for the topic, and your enthusiasm shines through in your writing. The narrative structure gives us a sense of progression, and I appreciate how you highlighted both the excitement and challenges of the role. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you've captured Luke's emotions and experiences. The details about his travels and the variety of animals he cared for help paint a vivid picture. However, there are some areas that need attention. For instance, there are several grammatical errors and typos that interrupt the flow of your writing. Words like ""amazing"" and ""opportunity"" need to be spelled correctly, and be mindful of punctuation, especially with possessives like ""Luke's."" Also, some sentences could use more clarity. For instance, the phrase ""but luckly for him he was still alive"" could be rephrased for a smoother reading experience. 

In terms of your argument about the importance of being a Seagoing Cowboy, you did well to express how fulfilling the job is for Luke and the impact he wanted to make on others. However, it would strengthen your argument to include more specific examples of how he helped people or what those consequences were when others doubted him. A little more detail would really drive your point home.

When it comes to your writing style, I see some good storytelling potential. You have a knack for creating excitement, but you need to work on your sentence structure and grammar. This will help your writing feel more polished. A few sentences were quite long and could be broken up for better readability. Aim for a mix of short and long sentences to keep your reader engaged.

Given your interest in the topic, I’d encourage you to read more essays or articles about similar professions. Pay attention to how they structure their arguments and present their experiences. Also, consider revising this essay by focusing on clarity—read it out loud to catch any awkward phrases or errors. 

Overall, I can see that you have a lot of potential in your writing. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to revise your work carefully. You’re on your way to creating compelling narratives!"

I appreciate the effort you put into this essay, and it’s clear you have a creative idea at the heart of it. You’ve chosen an interesting character in Luke, a cowboy who transitions from farm life to helping animals around the world. Overall, the story has potential, but it feels a bit disjointed at times, which can make it hard for readers to follow along.

One of the strengths of your essay is the unique premise. The idea of a cowboy helping animals during wars is not something one encounters often, and it shows your creativity. Additionally, your passion for the subject shines through, which is important when conveying a message. However, there are several areas where you could improve. For instance, the essay contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your storytelling. Words like ""oppertunity"" should be ""opportunity,"" and ""recived"" should be ""received."" These mistakes can confuse readers and detract from the strength of your arguments. Furthermore, the narrative jumps around a bit, making it challenging to understand the timeline of events. 

While you have a good concept, the argument about why one should join in helping animals could be more clearly defined. You mention that it’s an adventure and that it opens the world, but expanding on these points with more examples or personal anecdotes could really strengthen your message. For instance, what specific experiences did Luke have that made him feel like a hero? Sharing a particular story could help your readers connect more with his journey. 

In terms of your writing ability, I see promise, but there are some key areas to work on. Your style is straightforward, which is great, but refining your sentence structure will make your writing even more engaging. Sometimes, your sentences run on or feel incomplete, which can disrupt the flow. Work on varying your sentence length and structure to enhance readability. 

To develop your writing further, I suggest focusing on grammar and punctuation. You might benefit from reading your work aloud to catch errors or awkward phrasing. Additionally, consider outlining your essay before you start writing. This can help you organize your thoughts and create a clearer narrative arc. Finally, dive deeper into your character’s experiences. What specific moments stood out to him? What lessons did he learn? These details can make your essay more compelling and relatable.

Overall, you have a creative idea with a lot of potential. Keep writing and revising, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help when needed. I look forward to seeing how you refine your essay!"

I appreciate the effort you've put into telling Luke's story. You've chosen an interesting subject, and the experiences you highlight really paint a picture of his life as a seagoing cowboy. I can see your enthusiasm for the topic, and it’s clear you wanted to share something meaningful about Luke's adventures. However, the essay feels a bit scattered and could benefit from more organization and clarity.

One of the strengths of your writing is the intriguing content. The journey Luke takes is fascinating, and the various places he visits add depth to his story. I also like how you included quotes to express his thoughts about the experience; it gives a personal touch. On the flip side, there are several areas for improvement. The essay lacks a clear structure, which makes it challenging to follow. You jump from one idea to another without smooth transitions, which can confuse the reader. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your message. For instance, ""depolma"" should be ""diploma,"" and ""to go to with him on a cattle boat"" needs a little rephrasing for clarity.

As for your argument and use of examples, you have a solid foundation, but it needs more development. While you mention various experiences, there aren’t enough details or reflections on how these experiences impacted Luke or what he learned from them. For example, how did visiting China or touring The Panama Canal influence his perspective? Adding more depth to these experiences would strengthen your argument and help readers connect with the narrative on a deeper level.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show potential, but there are significant areas to work on. Your ideas are engaging, but the way they are presented can be improved. You have a unique voice that shines through, but it often gets lost in the errors and lack of cohesion. I noticed a few grammatical mistakes and punctuation issues that could be easily fixed with careful proofreading. 

To enhance this essay, I suggest starting with an outline before writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure a logical flow from one point to the next. Pay close attention to your sentence structure and punctuation—reading your essay out loud can help you catch errors and awkward phrasing. Lastly, don't hesitate to expand on key moments in Luke's journey. Reflect on how these experiences shaped his character and worldview. This will not only engage your readers more but also provide a richer understanding of your subject. 

Keep working at it! Your passion for the topic is evident, and with some focused revisions, I believe you can produce a compelling essay."

I appreciate your effort in tackling such a personal topic with emotional depth. It’s clear that you have a lot to say about Luke's decision, and your passion comes through when you discuss his love for his family and the responsibilities he feels toward them. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization and more polished language to enhance its effectiveness.

One of the strengths of your essay is the emotional connection you create between Luke and his family. You express his feelings of loyalty and protection well, which helps the reader understand why he chose not to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys. However, there are several areas where you could improve. The essay has numerous spelling and grammar mistakes, such as ""paticipate"" instead of ""participate"" and ""hat"" instead of ""had."" These errors can distract the reader and take away from the overall message you want to convey. Additionally, the flow of your ideas could be smoother. Some sentences are a bit repetitive, and you could work on combining shorter sentences to create a more coherent narrative.

In evaluating your argument, you do a good job of capturing the internal conflict Luke faces between duty and family. However, to strengthen your argument, consider providing more context about the Seagoing Cowboys and why this opportunity might have been significant. This would not only clarify Luke's decision but also deepen the reader's understanding of the stakes involved. 

Looking at your writing ability, I see potential for growth. You have a strong voice and clear emotional intent, which are vital for effective writing. The biggest challenge right now is your grammar and spelling, which can make your ideas harder to follow. Be sure to proofread your work before submitting it, as that can catch many of the small errors that distract from your message. 

To improve, I recommend taking the time to revise your essay carefully. Try to break down your ideas into clearer parts: introduce Luke’s situation, explain his feelings about the Seagoing Cowboys, and then discuss his final decision. Also, consider reading your essay out loud to help identify awkward phrasing or unclear sections. Engaging with others about your writing can also provide new insights and help you develop your style even further. 

Keep up the hard work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas in future essays!"
M15,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

Your essay presents a good overview of the passage and highlights some interesting points about being a seagoing cowboy. I can see that you find the topic engaging and you’ve included several key details from the text. However, there are some areas where you could improve the clarity and flow of your writing. 

I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject, and it’s clear that you have a genuine interest in what being a seagoing cowboy entails. You do a nice job of summarizing the experiences and adventures shared in the passage, especially when you mention the fun activities on board and the exciting places he could visit. However, some parts of your writing feel a bit repetitive, and there are several grammatical issues that detract from your message. For instance, make sure to proofread for typos like ""havig"" instead of ""having"" and ""latter"" instead of ""ladder."" These small errors can confuse your reader and take away from the overall impact of your essay.

While you do provide examples from the passage, they could be more clearly connected to your argument about why being a seagoing cowboy is a great opportunity for young boys. For example, you mention that he helped around the house and that this made him stronger, but you could elaborate on how these experiences prepared him for life at sea. Additionally, it would enhance your argument if you could discuss more about the skills or values learned from such experiences. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a good foundation, but there’s definitely room for growth. Your sentences sometimes lack variety and can be a bit choppy. Try to work on creating smoother transitions between sentences and ideas to help your writing flow better. Alongside that, watch out for punctuation and capitalization errors, such as ""boxxing"" instead of ""boxing."" 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on organizing your thoughts before you start writing, perhaps creating an outline. This way, you can ensure that each paragraph has a clear main idea and that your examples support that idea effectively. Additionally, read your work out loud or have someone else read it to catch any mistakes or awkward phrasing. 

You've got a solid start here, and with some revision and attention to detail, I believe your writing can really shine! Keep exploring this topic, and don’t hesitate to dive deeper into the experiences that make being a seagoing cowboy so special."

Reading your essay, I appreciate your enthusiasm for Luke and the program she's interested in. You clearly have strong feelings about the importance of following one's passion, which is a great message to share. However, the writing lacks clarity and organization, making it difficult to fully grasp your points. 

One strength of your essay is the passion you convey for Luke's journey. It's evident that you care about her aspirations and want to support her in achieving her dreams. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure. Right now, it feels a bit repetitive and scattered. It would help to outline your main points more clearly and ensure each paragraph focuses on a specific idea. For example, instead of repeating that ""Luke is a good person,"" you could explore different aspects of her character or motivations in each section. 

In terms of the argument you're trying to make, it's important to strengthen your points with more specific examples. You mention that Luke might enjoy the program and that it could help her, but you don't give us detailed reasons why or how. Adding more context or examples from the program or Luke’s experiences would make your argument more convincing. 

Regarding your writing ability, I can see that you have the potential for strong ideas and a unique voice. However, there are several areas where you could improve. For instance, pay attention to spelling and grammar, as there are multiple typos and awkward phrases that disrupt the flow of your writing. Consider breaking your sentences into shorter, clearer statements. This will help your reader follow your thoughts more easily. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest outlining your main ideas before you start writing. This way, you can ensure that each paragraph has a clear focus and contributes to your overall argument. Also, try to incorporate specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate your points about Luke's character or the program. Lastly, take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammar errors, as this can greatly impact the clarity of your writing.

With some adjustments and more focused examples, your passion for the topic will shine through even more, making your essay an engaging read. Keep up the hard work!"
M-F2,"The main characters were Luke and her friend. Basically the story is about her friend giving her a once in a life time opportunity. She first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When her friend invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. She couldnt say no. So then she went.

She had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem her friend invited her to Europe her whole llife had changed. Since there was a war she went to go help out. She and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowgirl. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and she was hired to be a seagoing cowgirl. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was her job over there in Europe.

She kept going there and she kept helping others. She like her job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town girl it had said. She really enjoyed her job. She toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowgirl. She traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took her about 2 weeks.

She was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. She had helped out her aunt Katie as a girl.

This essay tells an interesting story about Luke and her experiences as a seagoing cowgirl. It has a lot of potential and gives a glimpse into the life-changing opportunity that her friend offered her. However, the narrative feels a bit scattered and could benefit from more organization and depth. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the unique premise. The idea of a small-town girl taking on such an adventurous role during a time of need is compelling. You’ve captured the excitement and challenges of her journey, which makes for an engaging read. However, the essay would be more effective if it had a clearer structure. Sometimes, details seem to jump around, making it hard to follow the timeline of events. Focusing on a clear beginning, middle, and end would help strengthen your narrative.

Your argument about the impact of Luke's experiences is interesting, but it could use more development. For instance, you mention her cracked ribs and how that affected her ability to work, which is a significant moment. Expanding on her feelings about that situation or how it changed her perspective would add depth. Additionally, including more about what she learned from her experiences would create a stronger connection between her adventures and the overall theme of personal growth.

When it comes to your writing style, there are some notable strengths. You use vivid imagery, which helps draw the reader into the story. However, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""whem"" instead of ""when,"" ""ssums"" instead of ""sums,"" and ""whpole"" instead of ""whole."" These mistakes can distract the reader from your message, so take the time to proofread your work. Also, varying your sentence structure would improve the flow of your writing and keep the reader engaged. 

Since you seem interested in the topic, consider diving deeper into the emotional aspects of the story. What did Luke learn about herself, and how did her experiences shape her views on helping others? Adding specific moments of reflection or insight could make your essay resonate more with readers. 

To enhance your essay, make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar errors. Try to create an outline before writing to help organize your thoughts chronologically. Also, consider incorporating more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture of the settings and experiences. This will not only enrich your writing but also make it more enjoyable for your audience. Keep writing, as you have a unique voice and an interesting story to tell!"

You've put a lot of effort into your essay about Luke Bomberger's journey to becoming a seagoing cowgirl, and it’s clear you have an interest in the topic. The enthusiasm you have for Luke's story shines through, and it's great to see your passion for her adventures. However, there are areas where you can improve to make your essay clearer and more engaging.

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you highlight Luke's determination and the challenges she faced. You do a good job of showing her experiences, from her hard work on her aunt's farm to her adventures at sea. However, there are several areas for improvement. Your writing would benefit from more organization and structure. Right now, the essay feels a bit scattered, which makes it hard to follow. Try to group your ideas into clear paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of Luke's life or her journey. This will help your reader understand your points better.

When it comes to your argument and use of examples, you definitely provide some interesting details about Luke's life. However, some of your points could use more depth. For instance, you mention her experience with broken ribs but don't elaborate on what that meant for her journey. Adding more context or personal reflections on these events would strengthen your argument and give your readers a deeper understanding of her challenges.

In terms of writing competency and style, you've shown a good grasp of basic sentence structure, but there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors throughout your essay. Words like ""seaboy"" instead of ""seagoing"" and ""pharagraph"" instead of ""paragraph"" can distract the reader from your message. Make sure to proofread your work carefully before submitting it. Also, try to vary your sentence structures to keep your writing engaging. Short, choppy sentences can make it feel less fluid.

As someone who seems genuinely interested in Luke's story, I encourage you to dig deeper into her motivations and experiences. Reflecting on why she loves being a seagoing cowgirl could add a personal touch to your essay and help your readers connect with her on a more emotional level. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest starting with a clear outline before writing. Identify the main points you want to make and arrange them logically. After writing, read your essay out loud—this will help you catch any awkward phrasing or errors. Lastly, consider including a conclusion that reflects on Luke's journey and what it means to achieve one’s dreams. This will give your essay a satisfying sense of closure.

Keep up the hard work! With a little more focus on organization and detail, your writing can become even more powerful."

I appreciate the creativity and unique storyline you've presented in your essay. It's clear that you have an imaginative mind and a knack for storytelling. The blend of various elements—from working at jobs to an adventurous journey—creates an intriguing narrative that captures a reader's attention.

However, I want to point out that the essay could benefit from more clarity and structure. Right now, it feels a bit rushed and jumbled, which makes it hard to follow your main ideas. It would help to organize your thoughts into clearer paragraphs, each focusing on a specific part of your story. For instance, you might want to dedicate a paragraph to her jobs, another to her journey, and yet another to the challenges she faced. This will not only make your writing easier to read but also give your ideas the space they need to shine.

The vivid details you included about her experiences, like the long trip to see family and the unfortunate encounter with the dead mouse, add a lot of color to your essay. However, try to focus more on the character's feelings and motivations. Why is she a hard worker? What does she feel about her jobs or the challenges she faces? Adding this emotional depth will make your writing even more engaging and relatable.

In terms of your writing style, you have a good sense of storytelling, but there's room for improvement in grammar and punctuation. For example, watch out for sentence fragments and run-ons. Try to break up your ideas into complete sentences. This will not only help your writing flow better but will also make it easier for readers to understand your points.

Since you seem to have a strong interest in telling stories with interesting characters and settings, I recommend practicing writing more structured narratives. You could even try outlining your essays before you write them, which can help you organize your thoughts. Additionally, reading more essays or stories can give you a better sense of how to develop your ideas and improve your writing style.

Overall, you've got a good foundation to build on! Keep honing your skills, and don't hesitate to experiment with different ways of expressing your ideas. I look forward to seeing how your writing evolves in the future!"

First off, I appreciate your effort in tackling the topic of why Luke should not be a sea-going cowgirl. It’s clear that you put thought into the dangers involved, especially with references to World War II and personal experiences. However, the essay needs a bit more polish to clearly convey your points and strengthen your argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is your engagement with the topic. You have some interesting ideas about the risks involved in being a sea-going cowgirl, particularly about potential injuries and dangers from the environment. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization. Your paragraphs jump around a bit, making it hard to follow your argument. Try to ensure that each paragraph has a clear focus and flows into the next one logically. Also, be mindful of your grammar and spelling; there are several typos that distract from your message. 

When it comes to your argument, I see the potential in what you’re saying, but it could be bolstered with more specific examples and explanations. For instance, you mention that Luke could get hurt or experience seasickness, but providing more details or examples from her experiences would help strengthen your points. Also, instead of just listing dangers, consider exploring the implications of these dangers on her ability to do her job effectively.

In terms of writing competency, there's a solid foundation here, but there are definitely areas to improve. Your style shows promise, but you need to work on clarity and coherence. Punctuation and spelling errors can hinder your writing, so pay close attention to those as you revise. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend taking a step back and outlining your main points before you start writing. This can help you structure your thoughts more clearly. Also, consider revising your sentences for clarity; try to break down complex ideas into simpler parts. Finally, reading your essay aloud can help you catch awkward phrases or errors that you might miss when reading silently.

Overall, I can see you care about the topic, and with a little more attention to structure and detail, your writing can become much more effective. Keep at it!"

","I would rate this essay a 2 out of 5. 

Overall, your essay presents an interesting perspective on Luke and her experiences in the Seagoing Cowgirls program. However, it feels scattered and lacks a clear structure, which makes it a bit challenging to follow your main points. You have some good ideas, but they need to be organized more cohesively to strengthen your argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is your enthusiasm for the subject matter. It’s clear that you have a genuine interest in the Seagoing Cowgirls program and what it offers. Your mention of Luke's injury and her connection with her job adds a personal touch, making the reader curious about her story. However, there are several areas for improvement. For instance, punctuation and grammar are inconsistent, with misplaced apostrophes and run-on sentences that can confuse readers. Try breaking your ideas into shorter sentences, and double-check your grammar to ensure clarity.

When it comes to your argument and examples, while you touch on Luke’s passion for helping animals and her aspirations, these points could be developed further. You mention that Luke cracked some ribs, which could be a pivotal moment in your essay, but it feels a bit rushed. Expanding on how this injury impacts her future in the program would strengthen your argument. Additionally, incorporating more specific examples of what she does in the program could make your points more compelling.

In evaluating your writing ability, it seems that you have a solid grasp of the topic, which is wonderful. Your passion shines through, but the execution needs work. Some strengths include your ability to convey emotion and your genuine interest in the Seagoing Cowgirls. However, some weaknesses lie in sentence structure, punctuation, and clarity. 

To help you develop your writing, I recommend focusing on organizing your thoughts before you start writing. You might find it helpful to create an outline with main points and supporting details. Pay attention to sentence length; mixing short and longer sentences can create a better flow. Additionally, consider reviewing basic grammar rules to polish your writing. 

Overall, I see a lot of potential in your essay, and with some revisions and attention to detail, you can make your ideas shine even more! Keep working on it, and don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it."
M-F7,"Luke made a good idea to join the Seagoing cowgirls. But she also made a bad disision to take time out of her time to make it where she could play with her own friends and if I were her I would join but I woulnt because it would be bad if I couldnt get to hang out with my friends.

She might have joined because she wanted to help other people because she might have wanted to help load the cattle and not hang out with her friends but if she were to travel to anouther place away from her friends she would be sad and so would I.I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl but we all have our own ideas.

First off, it's clear that you have some thoughtful ideas about Luke's decision to join the Seagoing Cowgirls, and it's great to see you engaging with the topic! You’ve tried to explore different aspects of her choices, which shows that you’re considering multiple perspectives. However, the essay feels a bit scattered and could benefit from a clearer structure to guide the reader through your thoughts.

One of your strengths is that you show an understanding of the emotional conflict Luke faces between helping others and spending time with friends. This adds depth to your argument. However, there are quite a few areas that need improvement. For instance, the spelling and grammatical errors distract from your message. Words like ""disision,"" ""blam,"" and ""experiance"" should be corrected. Additionally, the essay could use more organization; it jumps around a bit, making it hard to follow your train of thought. Try to group similar ideas together and use transitions to connect them.

When it comes to your argument, I think it could be stronger if you provided specific examples or cases to back up your points. You mention that she might want to help others, but why do you think that? Maybe adding a personal touch or a story from your own life could make your argument more relatable. Also, consider addressing counterarguments more clearly—what might someone say in favor of joining the Seagoing Cowgirls?

As for your writing style, I see potential! You have a conversational tone that makes your essay engaging, but make sure to refine your grammar and sentence structure. For instance, instead of ""I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl,"" try to express that sentiment in a more mature way. This will make your writing stronger and more credible.

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on your grammar and spelling. You could practice writing short paragraphs and then revising them for clarity and correctness. Reading more essays on similar topics can also help you see how others structure their arguments. Lastly, when you revise this essay, try to create an outline before you start writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your argument flows logically from one point to the next.

Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing how you can improve your writing in the future!"

I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic and the way you express your thoughts about pursuing a job that you love. It’s clear that you have a passion for this subject, and you seem to have a strong connection to the idea of adventure and fulfilling one’s dreams. That’s a wonderful starting point for any essay! However, there are quite a few areas where your writing could be improved to make your argument clearer and more persuasive.

One of the strengths of your essay is the passion that shines through. You really want to convey why you think people should pursue this job, and that enthusiasm is important. However, there are several areas that need work, particularly with spelling, grammar, and organization. Many words are misspelled, which makes it hard to read, and some sentences are repetitive or unclear. Try to focus on organizing your ideas in a more structured way, which will help your readers follow your thoughts more easily.

While your argument about why people should take on this job is interesting, it could be strengthened by providing specific examples or stories. For instance, mentioning a specific person who has taken this job and what they experienced could add depth to your argument. Currently, it feels a bit generalized and could benefit from more details. Also, consider addressing potential counterarguments—what if someone doesn’t enjoy this type of work? Discussing that could make your essay more balanced.

In terms of writing competency, you have a good foundation with your ability to express your thoughts, but there are significant weaknesses in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. These issues can distract from your main ideas. I suggest you start reading your work out loud to catch errors and improve the flow of your sentences. Additionally, practice writing shorter sentences to clarify your ideas and help avoid run-on sentences.

Because you seem genuinely interested in this topic, I encourage you to delve deeper into why you think this job is fulfilling. Researching some real-life examples or experiences of others in this profession could provide valuable insights and enhance your argument. Also, consider outlining your essay before you write it, which can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that you stay on track. 

Overall, you have the heart and passion for this topic, and with some focused effort on your writing mechanics and organization, I believe you can create a compelling essay. Keep writing and practicing—you're on the right path!"

Also she had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also she visited many unique places while she was on the trip as she did in the story.

I appreciate the effort you've put into this essay! You’ve tackled an interesting topic, and it seems like you have a genuine interest in the subject matter related to the adventure and the historical context of World War II. Your enthusiasm really shines through, and that’s a great foundation to build on. 

There are definitely some strong points in your writing. You have a clear passion for the topic, which is evident in how you describe the adventure and the importance of helping others. The way you reference the emotional aspects of the journey adds a personal touch. However, there are areas where you could improve. For instance, your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Each paragraph should have a main idea that connects smoothly to the next, allowing your reader to follow your thoughts more easily. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your overall message. Taking the time to proofread would help clarify your ideas.

As for your argument, you make some good points about the reasons for joining this adventure and how those reasons are supported by emotional experiences. However, it would be more effective if you provided specific examples or quotes from the story to back up your claims. This would help ground your arguments and give your reader a clearer understanding of the character's experiences and motivations. 

In terms of writing ability, you show promise! You have a good grasp of the main ideas you want to convey, but your writing style could be more polished. Focus on sentence structure and clarity. Sometimes, your sentences are a bit long and could use punctuation for better flow. For example, breaking up complex ideas into shorter sentences can make them easier to digest. 

I recommend that you read your essay out loud before submitting it next time. This can help you catch awkward phrasing or run-on sentences. Also, try to elaborate more on your points by including specific examples from the story to support your thoughts. This will not only strengthen your argument but also engage your reader more effectively. Lastly, dedicating some time to work on your spelling and grammar will make a significant difference in how your writing is perceived. Keep working at it—your interest in the topic is a fantastic motivator, and with more practice, your writing will definitely improve!"

Your essay presents an interesting narrative about Luke and her experience as a seagoing cowgirl. It captures the excitement of a new opportunity and the challenges she faces along the way. I appreciate your effort to share her story, but there are several areas where you can improve to make your writing clearer and more engaging.

Overall, I think you have a solid idea at the core of your essay, but the execution needs some refinement. The storyline has potential, and it’s great that you’ve included elements of adventure and personal growth. However, the flow of the writing feels a bit choppy at times, and there are some grammatical and spelling errors that distract from the narrative. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the unique perspective of a young girl taking on a traditionally male role in a setting like the sea. It adds depth to her character and makes the story more relatable. However, the areas that need improvement include grammar, sentence structure, and clarity of ideas. For instance, your sentences can be quite fragmented, making it hard for readers to follow. You might want to focus on combining shorter sentences or expanding on ideas to create smoother transitions.

Your argument about how this experience opens up a new world for Luke is compelling, but it could be strengthened with more detailed examples. You mention her love for the job and the activities she engages in, but it would be helpful to delve deeper into her feelings or experiences during those moments. You could describe a particular event that illustrates her growth, like how she felt after overcoming her injury or what specific lessons she learned from her time on the boat.

In terms of writing competency, you show enthusiasm for the topic, which is fantastic! Your style is conversational and engaging, but it sometimes comes off as too informal, which can take away from the seriousness of your subject matter. Focus on refining your language; for example, using proper nouns and avoiding phrases like ""smal city girl"" can elevate your writing. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend revisiting your grammar and punctuation. Simple proofreading can catch many of the small errors that detract from your message. Additionally, consider expanding on the emotional journey of your character. What did she learn about herself? How did her experiences change her perspective on life? These details will enrich your essay and help your readers connect with Luke on a more personal level.

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build on. Keep writing and refining your skills, and don't hesitate to dig deeper into your characters’ emotions and experiences!"
M-F11,"A argument Luke is dealing with from her point of view is how much things she has to do and if she does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job she was so excited about it. She heard that being a Seagoing Cowgirl was a amazing job. She has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowgirl because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowgirls, she couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, she was so excited to start working. She worked and worked all the time. She wanted to be the best Seagoing cowgirl there has ever been. Sometimes she would work more than she was soppost to. She enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. She went to alot of places. She went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as she was done with all the traveling she made nine trips all together! She made more trips than any Seagoing Cowgirl!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip she served her night as a watchman. She had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making her hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. She landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped her slide, that kept her from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for her she was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, she got her ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work she managed her time to have fun on board. She played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. She played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowgirl she thought of how amazing it feels to help people. She helped lots of people during her trips. So Luke had a great idea. She wanted people to help other people. She started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. But most of people thought she was crazy. She told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called her job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought she was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. But She didn't give up on her job though. She liked her job the way it is and she wouldn't change it for anything. She got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in her job.","

I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of being a Seagoing Cowgirl, and it’s clear you have a passion for the subject. Your essay presents an interesting narrative about Luke's experiences, which is engaging and relatable. The excitement you convey about the job comes through well, and it’s great to see how you’ve captured the highs and lows of her journey. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the vivid way you describe Luke's experiences and her feelings about her job. You’ve painted a picture of her adventures and challenges, which is enjoyable to read. However, there are areas where you could improve. For instance, the essay could benefit from better organization and clarity in your writing. Some sentences are a bit awkward or unclear, making it challenging for the reader to follow Luke’s story smoothly. Additionally, pay attention to spelling and grammatical errors; these can distract from your main message and take away from the overall quality.

When it comes to the argument about the challenges and rewards of Luke’s job, I think it could be strengthened with more specific examples. You mention her hard work and the dangers she faces, but diving deeper into her emotional journey or providing concrete outcomes from her efforts would make your argument more compelling. For example, you could elaborate on how the challenges she faced shaped her character or influenced her relationships with the people and animals she helped.

In terms of your writing ability, you show a good grasp of storytelling, but refining your style will make your essays even stronger. You have a knack for creating engaging narratives, but focus on structuring your thoughts more clearly. Practicing sentence variety can also help you avoid repetition and keep the reader's interest. 

To enhance your essay, consider breaking it into more distinct sections with clear transitions. This will help guide your reader through Luke’s journey more effectively. Additionally, make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar; tools like spell check can be helpful, but reading your essay aloud can also catch errors that might slip through. Lastly, try to delve deeper into the emotional aspects of Luke’s experiences, which can really resonate with your audience. Overall, you have a solid foundation, and with a bit more attention to detail and structure, your writing will shine even brighter!"

I enjoyed reading your essay about Luke and her adventurous life dedicated to helping animals. The concept of a cowgirl who works in various roles and eventually joins the army to aid injured animals is unique and engaging. Your enthusiasm for the topic really shines through, and it’s clear that you have a creative mind filled with interesting ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your imaginative storyline. The character of Luke is relatable and admirable, and the premise of her helping animals in different parts of the world is heartwarming. However, there are several areas where you can enhance your writing. For one, the essay has quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from the overall message. Words like ""oppertunity,"" ""recived,"" and ""honar"" need to be corrected. Additionally, the sentence structure can be improved for better clarity. For example, you often start sentences in a similar way, which can make the writing feel repetitive.

Your argument about the importance of helping animals comes through, but it would be stronger with more specific examples of how Luke’s actions made a difference. Instead of just stating that she went to New Orleans or that she helped animals, you might include a specific story or moment that illustrates her impact. This would give your readers a clearer picture of her journey and the challenges she faced. 

In terms of writing competency, you have great ideas and a solid narrative, but the execution needs refining. Your strengths lie in your creativity and passion for the subject, which is fantastic. On the flip side, paying more attention to spelling, grammar, and sentence variety will significantly improve your writing. 

To develop your writing skills further, I recommend reading more essays or stories that inspire you. Notice how other writers structure their sentences and use varied vocabulary. Before submitting your work, take the time to proofread for any errors and think about ways to elaborate on your main points with more detailed examples. 

Overall, you have a wonderful foundation to build upon—keep writing and refining your skills!"

Your essay about Luke Bomber and her adventures as a seagoing cowgirl presents an interesting narrative, but it needs some work on clarity and structure. The overall concept is intriguing, and I can see your enthusiasm for the topic. However, the execution leaves room for improvement.

Let’s start with the overall impression. You’ve chosen a unique subject that not many people might know about, which is great. However, the essay feels a bit disjointed at times. It jumps from one idea to another without smooth transitions, making it hard for readers to follow the story. Try to create a clearer narrative flow. 

In terms of strengths, your choice of topic is definitely a highlight. You provide some fascinating details about Luke's experiences, which makes the reader want to know more. However, the areas for improvement are quite significant. There are several grammatical errors, and some sentences are awkwardly phrased. For example, “the girl who ride wave paragraph” is confusing and doesn’t set the stage well. Pay attention to your sentence structure, and try to proofread your work for typos, such as ""depolma"" instead of ""diploma.""

When it comes to your argument and use of examples, you have some solid points, but they need to be better connected. For instance, you mention her travels and experiences, but you don’t fully explain how these shaped her perspective. You could enhance your essay by expanding on specific experiences, like her time in China or her work on the farm, to illustrate her growth and what she learned along the way.

Now, regarding your writing ability, you show promise, but clarity and coherence are areas that need focus. Your enthusiasm for the subject shines through, which is a strength, but the way you express your thoughts can be improved. Try to organize your ideas more logically and ensure each paragraph flows into the next. 

To develop your writing, I recommend practicing your proofreading skills. Read your work out loud to catch awkward phrasing or mistakes. Additionally, consider creating an outline before writing to help organize your thoughts and ensure you cover all aspects of your topic in a logical order. 

Lastly, remember that your writing can convey not just facts but also your insights and reflections. Don’t hesitate to share what Luke’s experiences meant to you or how they connect to broader themes. Doing so can deepen the impact of your essay and engage your readers more effectively. Keep working on it, and I’m excited to see how you can improve your writing!"

The essay touches on a personal decision that highlights the importance of family and safety during a challenging time, which is a compelling theme. However, the execution leaves much to be desired. The narrative feels disjointed, and there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and impact of your message.

One of the strengths of your essay is the emotional connection to the character, Luke. You clearly articulate why she chose to stay home instead of joining the Seagoing Cowgirls, emphasizing her love for her family and the desire to protect them. This emotional core is vital and could resonate well with readers. However, the organization of your thoughts could be improved. Right now, the essay jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it difficult for readers to follow your argument. Additionally, spelling mistakes and grammatical errors—like ""paticipate"" instead of ""participate"" and ""pertect"" instead of ""protect""—distract from your message. 

When evaluating your argument and examples, it's clear that you have a strong point about family loyalty and the dangers of leaving loved ones behind. However, the lack of specific examples or further elaboration on the dangers faced makes the argument feel underdeveloped. For instance, you could explore what specific challenges Luke and her family faced or provide more context about the Seagoing Cowgirls that would help clarify her decision. This would strengthen your argument and give readers a clearer understanding of the stakes involved.

In terms of writing ability, I see potential, but there are some noticeable weaknesses. Your writing conveys an important message, but the style is quite informal and riddled with errors that can confuse readers. On the positive side, your voice comes through, which is important for engaging your audience. However, you should work on sentence structure, punctuation, and word choice for clarity. 

To enhance your essay, focus on revising your sentences for coherence. Try reading your essay out loud to identify awkward phrasing. Also, make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar. Consider breaking your ideas into clearer sections or paragraphs, each with a main point that supports your overall argument. It might help to create an outline before writing to organize your thoughts better. Finally, think about including more specific examples that illustrate the challenges Luke faced, which will make your argument more compelling and relatable. 

Keep writing, and remember that practice is key to improvement!"
M-F15,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl. She is trying to tell girls that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowgirl. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowgirl. What she is saying is that she is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story she states that she went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. She says that she could go to China, and Europe on her extra time, and that she enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that she helped around the house as a young girl, and that helped her grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. She also states that she was a night watchmen, and she checked the animals every hour.

She also says that one night she was sliding downa latter on her back side and almost fell off the ship. All though she couldn't work for a few days, she satses that she was very thankful to be alive.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowgirl would be a good idea for young girls for somthing to do for a while.","

Your essay does a good job of summarizing the main points from the passage, but it could benefit from a bit more depth and organization. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic and your effort to convey the excitement of being a seagoing cowgirl. However, some parts feel a little rushed or unclear. 

You’ve highlighted some key experiences from the passage, such as the protagonist's travels and the challenges she faced. These are important elements that capture the essence of her journey. One strength in your writing is your ability to convey the adventurous spirit of the seagoing cowgirl lifestyle, which is engaging. However, there are areas where clarity and coherence could be improved. For instance, some sentences are difficult to follow because of minor grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. Additionally, the organization of your essay could be enhanced. Consider structuring your points more clearly, perhaps by grouping similar ideas together and using transitions to guide the reader through your thoughts.

When it comes to your argument, you raise a good point about the benefits of being a seagoing cowgirl for young girls, but more elaboration would strengthen your position. You mention her experiences in Greece and China as significant, but you don’t explore why these experiences matter or how they relate to the overall message of empowerment. Including more specific examples from the text to support your claims would make your argument more compelling. 

Your writing shows potential, but there are areas for improvement, particularly in grammar and sentence structure. Some sentences contain typos, such as “havig” instead of “having” and “boxxing” instead of “boxing.” Paying attention to these details will enhance the professionalism of your writing. 

One recommendation is to take your time during the drafting process. After writing, give your essay a careful read to catch any mistakes and ensure that your ideas flow logically. Additionally, consider expanding on your ideas; instead of just stating facts, try to connect them back to your main argument. For example, when you mention the protagonist's fun activities on board, you could discuss how these experiences contribute to her overall growth and happiness.

Overall, I can see that you're interested in the topic, and I encourage you to dig deeper into your analysis. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to ask for feedback—this will help you grow as a writer!"
F1,"Claim: This story is really about how many people studying about Mona Lisa and how the way her mood is.

First off, I appreciate your effort in tackling such an intriguing topic! The Mona Lisa is a fascinating subject, and you’ve touched on some interesting points regarding her emotions and the technology used to study her. It’s clear you have a curiosity about this subject, which is great. However, the essay reads a bit like a rough draft; there are some areas that could really use refinement to improve clarity and coherence.

You’ve got some solid ideas, especially when discussing how people analyze Mona Lisa’s emotions through technology. I think your choice to mention the use of a 3D computer to explore different emotions is quite engaging. However, the essay lacks a clear structure. Your introduction could be more compelling, and your conclusion feels a little abrupt. Try to balance your paragraphs better by organizing your thoughts into a clear beginning, middle, and end. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

One of the main areas you could work on is clarity in your writing. Some sentences are a bit confusing or contain spelling errors, such as ""dosent"" instead of ""doesn't"" and ""notist"" instead of ""noticed."" These small mistakes can distract from your overall message. Additionally, try to elaborate more on your points. For instance, when you mention the impressive calculations made about her feelings, consider explaining a bit more about what those calculations entail. This will help your reader understand the significance of the analysis and keep them engaged.

As for your writing style, I see that you’re enthusiastic about the topic, which is fantastic! However, there’s room for improvement in the way you express your ideas. Sometimes the phrasing feels a bit awkward. Practice reading your writing out loud; this can help you catch any sentences that don’t flow well. Additionally, varying your sentence structure can make your writing more dynamic. 

Given your interest in the topic, I would encourage you to dive deeper into the research surrounding Mona Lisa. Perhaps explore more about the historical context of the painting or the specific technologies used in analyzing her expressions. This could provide more depth to your argument and make it more persuasive.

To enhance your essay, I suggest starting with a stronger thesis statement that clearly outlines what you’ll discuss. Work on developing each point with supporting details and examples. Pay attention to your grammar and spelling, and consider using transitions between ideas to create a smoother reading experience. Overall, you have a good foundation here; with some revisions and additional detail, you can create a more compelling piece! Keep up the hard work!"

Your essay on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" shows a lot of potential, but there are some areas that need attention to make your ideas clearer and more impactful. You clearly have an interest in the topic, which is great, and you approach it with a unique perspective on the subject matter.

Your overall impression conveys that you’ve thought deeply about the mood and expression of the Mona Lisa, which is a solid foundation for your analysis. However, the flow of your writing could use some work. Some sentences feel a bit jumbled, which makes it hard to follow your thoughts. It would help to organize your ideas more clearly, perhaps by breaking them into distinct paragraphs for each major point.

One of the strengths of your essay is your interpretation of Mona Lisa's expression. You describe her smile as both happy and indifferent, which is a compelling take. However, your writing would benefit from more clarity and structure. For instance, you mention the colors and the surroundings but don’t fully develop those ideas. Consider elaborating on how the background contributes to your interpretation of her mood. 

When evaluating your argument, while you provide some interesting observations, they could be solidified with more concrete examples from the painting. For instance, discussing specific elements of the background or details in her expression would help to support your claims better. Additionally, refining your vocabulary could enhance your descriptions and make your insights more vivid.

Regarding your writing competency and style, I see a lot of creativity, but there are some weaknesses in grammar and punctuation that could distract from your message. For example, using complete sentences and correct punctuation will make your writing clearer and more professional. 

To improve, focus on developing clear topic sentences for each paragraph and supporting those with detailed explanations. Practicing sentence structure and punctuation will also help. Reading more essays or articles on art analysis can give you a better sense of how to articulate your thoughts effectively. 

Overall, you have a good start here, and with some revisions, I believe your essay could become a much more compelling piece. Keep up the good work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to discuss your ideas further!"

Overall, your essay presents an interesting and creative perspective on the Mona Lisa and how technology might alter our perception of her expression. I appreciate your imaginative approach, but there is quite a bit of room for improvement in clarity and organization. The ideas you’ve put forth are intriguing, but they sometimes get lost in the way they are expressed.

One of the strengths of your essay is the originality of your concept. The idea of a computer program altering Mona Lisa’s smile is unique and engaging. You also touch on some interesting points about emotions and how they can be interpreted or manipulated through technology. However, the areas that need more attention include sentence structure and grammar. Many sentences are run-on or awkwardly phrased, which can make it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts. It would be beneficial to break down complex ideas into simpler sentences and ensure that each thought is clearly articulated.

Regarding your argument and use of examples, while the premise of your essay is compelling, it lacks a strong foundation of evidence or references to support your claims. You mention Thomas Huang and his software, but it would strengthen your argument if you provided more context about who he is and how his work relates to the Mona Lisa. Additionally, the details about the percentages of her emotional state feel a bit disconnected and would benefit from further explanation to clarify their significance in your argument.

When it comes to your writing competency and style, you show potential, but there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed. Your enthusiasm for the topic is evident, but the execution sometimes hinders your message. This could improve with more careful proofreading and attention to the flow of your writing. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend starting by outlining your main points before writing. This can help you organize your thoughts more clearly. Focus on writing shorter, more concise sentences to improve readability. Additionally, consider conducting more research on the Mona Lisa and the technology you mention; this can provide you with more substance to support your ideas. Finally, take some time to review grammar and punctuation rules. Small errors can distract from the strength of your argument, and polishing these will make your writing shine. 

Keep up the creative thinking, and I look forward to seeing how you can refine your ideas in your next draft!"

Overall, this essay has a charming premise and a relatable father-daughter dynamic. There’s a sense of nostalgia that can resonate with readers, especially through the character of Luke, who seems to have a vibrant past. However, the execution leaves room for improvement. The dialogues are engaging, but the narrative lacks clarity in places, making it a bit confusing to follow at times. 

One of the strengths of your writing is the dialogue; it feels natural and adds depth to the characters. The playful banter between Luke and his daughter gives readers insight into their relationship, which is a great touch. However, there are several areas where you could improve. First, pay attention to grammar and spelling; there are quite a few typos, like “enturupted” instead of “interrupted” and “daugter” instead of “daughter.” These errors can distract from your story. Additionally, the narrative sometimes jumps around without clear transitions, making it hard to follow Luke’s story. Providing a bit more context or description would help ground the reader in the scene.

In terms of your argument and examples, the essay hints at a deeper story about family and the complexities of memory, but it feels underdeveloped. You mention Luke’s journeys to various places, but you don’t delve into how these experiences shaped him or his relationship with his daughter. Adding concrete examples from his past would strengthen your essay and give readers a clearer picture of why these stories matter to both characters. 

Looking at your writing ability, you show promise, especially in capturing dialogue and character interaction. However, the mechanics of writing—such as grammar, punctuation, and structure—need attention. Strengths include your ability to create engaging conversations that feel authentic. On the flip side, the weaknesses lie in clarity and coherence; some parts of your narrative are unclear or feel rushed. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend reading more stories that feature strong character development and clear narratives. Pay close attention to how those authors handle dialogue and transitions between scenes. It might also help to revise your work by reading it out loud; this can help you catch typos and awkward sentences. Lastly, consider expanding on your characters’ backstories. What specific memories does Luke cherish? How do those stories impact his daughter? Taking the time to flesh out these details will make your essay more engaging and meaningful. 

Overall, you have a solid foundation, and with some revisions and attention to detail, you can create a compelling narrative that truly captures the reader's interest. Keep writing and exploring your ideas!"
F5,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

I see what you're trying to do here, and it’s clear that you have some interesting thoughts on the Mona Lisa and the emotions that can be interpreted from her expression. Your essay tackles a complex topic and provides a personal perspective, which is great. However, there are points where the clarity and structure get a bit muddled, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument fully.

One of the strengths of your essay is your unique viewpoint. You challenge the idea that we can definitively read emotions from someone's face, which opens up a broader discussion about how emotions are perceived and expressed. This is a compelling angle, especially in the context of art. However, the essay could greatly benefit from better organization. Right now, your thoughts feel a bit scattered, and some of your sentences are quite lengthy, which can confuse readers. Consider breaking your ideas into clearer sections and using more straightforward sentences to improve readability. 

When it comes to your argument, you do a good job of questioning the claims made about the Mona Lisa’s emotions and the statistics presented. However, it would be even stronger if you backed up your points with more concrete examples or references to research on facial expressions and emotions. For instance, bringing in additional scholarly perspectives or studies on emotional expression could really enhance your argument. Also, you mention facial feedback theory but don’t explore it deeply enough. A little more explanation of this concept would help provide context for your readers.

In terms of writing competency, there are several areas where you can improve. Your style has potential, but it needs more polish. Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling; “wasnt” should be “wasn’t,” and “expiriencing” should be corrected to “experiencing.” These small errors can distract from your message. Additionally, your use of informal phrases like “something was good about her and only her” can be refined to sound more academic. 

If you’re passionate about art and emotions, consider diving deeper into the emotional theories that relate to your argument. Practice structuring your essays with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and aim to keep your sentences concise. It might also help to read more essays on similar topics to see how structured arguments are presented effectively.

Overall, you have an intriguing perspective, and with some refinement in your writing style and structure, you can make your essays even more compelling. Keep working on it!"
F6,"I am against it. The people that show no emotion do it for a reason.

Most likely people show no emotion on their face becasue they don't want people to know how they feel. It gives people the hint saying i don't want to talk to you or just leave me alone.

Some students tend to be closed off from people and that's how they like it and want to be left alone. It's most likely the ones that don't show emotion had a bad past, something horrible happened recently and don't want people to find out, Etc. For example, a girl recently moved in with her father after 16 years living with her mother. She wanted a new change so she left but what people don't know is that she cries at night for leaving her other siblings and mother etc. She wouldn't want people to know how she really feels, so she hides it away showing no emotion or having a fake emotion on her face. She doesn't want anyone to know what's going on in her life or just doesn't want people in her buisness.

That is why we shouldn't use the new technology of indentifying emotions on people that obviously dont't want to. Not everybody is the same , has a good life like others or a bad one. Also, just because someone is bored the computer that can identify emotions shouldn't try to make the next thing they watch or do more fun for them. In the real world you go through things that is as boring as looking at a wall all day. So, they shouldn't get used to everything being fun because it's not.   ","

Your essay brings up an interesting perspective about emotional expression and the implications of technology in understanding it. I appreciate your stance against the use of technology to identify emotions, and it’s clear that you’re passionate about the subject. However, there’s room for improvement in both clarity and depth.

Your overall impression is compelling, but the argument could benefit from more organization. The central idea that some people hide their emotions for personal reasons is strong, but it gets a bit muddled in execution. It would help to start with a clear thesis statement that outlines your main points. This gives readers a roadmap of what to expect and helps keep your writing focused.

One of the strengths of your essay is the use of a personal example, which adds emotional weight to your argument. It’s relatable and helps illustrate your point about people who conceal their emotions. However, the example could be woven more tightly into your argument. Expanding on how this girl’s experience reflects broader issues could strengthen your case. Additionally, there are a few grammatical errors and typos, such as ""buisness"" instead of ""business"" and ""dont't"" instead of ""don’t."" Proofreading your work can help polish your writing and make your argument clearer.

In terms of your writing style, I can see that you have a good voice and a genuine tone, which makes your essay engaging. But, sometimes the sentences are a bit choppy, which can disrupt the flow. Try to vary your sentence structure and connect your ideas more smoothly. This will enhance readability and keep your audience engaged. 

Given your interest in the topic, you might want to explore more diverse examples or research that supports your argument. Perhaps look into psychological studies or articles on emotional intelligence. This can provide a richer context for your points and make your argument more persuasive.

To enhance your essay, I suggest starting with a clear introduction that outlines your argument. Use transitions to connect your ideas, and try to expand on your examples to illustrate your points more deeply. Finally, take time to proofread your work for any grammatical errors or typos. This will help ensure your ideas shine through without distractions. Keep writing and refining your style; you’re on the right path!"
F7,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that she was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if she's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with her at that time of the picture you would never know how she's feeling. Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling.

Overall, your essay presents a clear stance against the effectiveness of the Facial Coding System in determining emotions. It’s evident that you’ve given this topic some thought, and I appreciate your effort to express your opinion. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure and more depth in your argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is your passionate viewpoint. You effectively communicate your belief that emotions are best understood through direct interaction rather than through technology. Your choice to reference the Mona Lisa adds an interesting angle to your argument, as it connects historical art to contemporary discussions about emotion and technology. On the downside, the essay lacks organization and clarity. Some sentences are quite long and can be difficult to follow. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, such as ""perent"" which should be ""percent,"" and “andd” which should be “and.” 

When it comes to your argument, while you make a valid point about the limitations of technology in understanding emotions, it would strengthen your essay if you included more examples or evidence to support your claims. You mention the Mona Lisa, but you could expand this by discussing how emotions can be subjective and personal, which technology might fail to capture. Providing a counterargument to acknowledge the possible benefits of the Facial Coding System could also make your argument more robust and nuanced.

Regarding your writing ability, you show promise but also have areas that need improvement. Your ideas are relevant and thought-provoking, but your writing style could be clearer and more concise. There are moments where your meaning gets lost in long sentences, and it would help to break them down into shorter, more focused statements. Additionally, double-checking for spelling and grammatical errors will enhance the overall professionalism of your writing.

To develop your skills further, I would recommend practicing outlining your essays before you write them. This can help with organization and ensure that your arguments flow logically from one point to the next. Additionally, reading more essays or articles on similar topics might inspire you and provide insight into how to structure your own arguments effectively. Lastly, consider revising your drafts after writing to catch any errors and refine your points.

Overall, you have a strong interest in the topic, and with some focused practice, I believe you can enhance both your writing skills and the clarity of your arguments. Keep pushing yourself, and don’t hesitate to ask for feedback as you continue to grow as a writer!"
F8,"Imagine a woman is late to work and her hair is a mess, she threw random clothees on, and all her work papers are stored in random places in her briefcase. But if she owns a driverless car, the woman could sort out her paper files, fix her hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the lady in the story has a regular car, who knows if she will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that she will be, and she will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or she is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or she for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the woman in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the woman probably have gotten into a car crash because she was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the lady did have a driverless car, she would have been on time for work and she would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents.

I appreciate your effort in tackling the topic of driverless cars! The concept you chose—a woman rushing to work and the potential benefits of a driverless car—offers a relatable scenario that many can identify with. It sets the stage nicely for discussing the advantages of this technology. 

There are definitely some strengths in your writing. For instance, you emphasize safety well and tie it back to the woman’s situation, which makes your argument more engaging. I also noticed you referenced specific passages to support your points, which is a good practice. However, there are several areas where you could improve. One major aspect is the organization of your essay. It feels a bit scattered at times, moving from point to point without smooth transitions. Additionally, some sentences contain grammatical errors and typos, such as ""driveless"" instead of ""driverless"" and ""clothees"" instead of ""clothes,"" which can distract from your message. 

Your argument about the positives of driverless cars is compelling, but it could benefit from clearer structure and stronger examples. Right now, your essay feels more like a collection of thoughts rather than a cohesive argument. While you do mention safety multiple times, consider diving deeper into how it contrasts with the negative aspects of driverless cars, perhaps by acknowledging common concerns people have about them, like technology failures or cybersecurity risks. This could strengthen your argument by showing you recognize different perspectives.

In terms of your writing style, it feels conversational, which is a great asset, especially for engaging readers. Yet, there’s a need for refinement in your sentence structure. Some sentences are a bit long and could be broken down for clarity. Moreover, there are instances where your phrasing can be tightened up, such as “the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it,” which could be simplified. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on clarity and organization. Start with a clear thesis statement in your introduction that outlines your main argument, and then ensure each paragraph revolves around a single idea that supports that thesis. Try to use more varied sentence structures to keep your writing dynamic and avoid repetition. Finally, proofreading your essay for grammatical errors and typos can significantly enhance the overall quality of your work.

Given your interest in this topic, consider researching more about the technology behind driverless cars and their potential impact on society. This could enrich your arguments and provide substance to your claims. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you can refine your ideas in future essays!"
F9,"The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results.

By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because she is smiling, she couldve been fearful because she didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and she couldve been angery because at the time she wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work.

Overall, your essay touches on a fascinating topic about the intersection of technology and art, specifically regarding the emotions expressed in the Mona Lisa. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the ideas you present, but the execution requires more clarity and organization. Your points are interesting, but they get a bit muddled, making it challenging for the reader to follow your argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is your engagement with the subject matter. You clearly find the topic intriguing, and you attempt to connect modern technology to historical art. This is a great angle! However, your essay needs more structure. The flow from one idea to another is sometimes abrupt, which can confuse readers. Also, there are quite a few grammatical errors and typos—like ""belive,"" ""angery,"" and ""staed""—that detract from the overall professionalism of your writing. Proofreading your work would help polish your ideas and strengthen your argument.

In terms of evaluating your argument, while you present some compelling ideas about the Facial Action Coding System and its relevance to understanding the Mona Lisa's expression, the support for your claims could be stronger. You mention statistics about her supposed emotions but don’t provide enough context or explanation for how those numbers were derived. Additionally, your mention of da Vinci studying anatomy is a solid point, but it would benefit from more elaboration on how that knowledge translates to the painting itself. Consider providing specific examples or quotes from sources to back up your claims about facial expressions and technology.

Your writing style shows potential, but it needs clarity and coherence. You have a good foundation, but you might want to focus on organizing your thoughts more logically. For instance, starting with a clear thesis statement can guide your reader through your argument. 

As someone interested in the intersection of art and technology, I encourage you to dive deeper into research on the Facial Action Coding System. This could provide you with more substantial evidence and examples to support your points. Additionally, consider structuring your essay with clear paragraphs, each with a single main idea that connects back to your thesis. This will make your argument more persuasive and easier to follow.

Overall, keep your curiosity alive and use it as a driving force to improve your writing. With more focus and attention to detail, I’m confident your essays will become even more compelling!"

Overall, your essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the challenges associated with studying Venus and effectively supports the argument that it's a worthwhile endeavor. You’ve clearly engaged with the material and provided a solid structure to your points. The way you summarize the author's claims and counterarguments shows a good understanding of the text.

One of the strengths of your essay is the clarity with which you outline the problems and solutions related to Venus exploration. You do a great job of summarizing the key points and connecting them back to the central argument. However, there are areas that could use some refinement. For instance, it would be beneficial to include more specific details from the text and perhaps a deeper analysis of the implications of these challenges and solutions. This would not only strengthen your argument but also demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the topic.

Your argument is well-supported by examples, particularly when you mention NASA's plans to send humans in a blimp-like vehicle and the technology being tested for harsh conditions. These examples are relevant and help illustrate your points effectively. However, you could enhance your analysis by exploring why these solutions are significant beyond just overcoming the immediate challenges. What does this mean for the future of space exploration or our understanding of Venus? Diving deeper into these implications could add more depth to your essay.

In terms of writing competency, your style is clear and straightforward, which is great for conveying your ideas. However, watch out for repetitive phrasing and minor grammatical errors, like ""30 or so milles"" instead of ""miles"" and ""ground counditions"" instead of ""ground conditions."" These small mistakes can distract from your overall message. 

Since you seem to have a genuine interest in the topic, take this opportunity to push yourself further. Try to incorporate a more varied vocabulary and sentence structure to keep your writing engaging. It might also help to read your essay aloud to catch any awkward phrasing or errors you might have missed.

To strengthen your essay, consider adding an introductory paragraph that sets the stage for your argument.

F11,Making mona lisa smile agian was the main topic detail in the story. For one reason it would have to be when they painted a picture of her for acomplishing the process of the model of a great model she smiled for that picture. So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one. The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence. Inside Paragraph 4 it is telling about how the expression of the real face is inside the art of Mona Lisa.,"

I appreciate the effort you've put into your essay about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile Again."" You've chosen an intriguing topic that allows for a lot of creativity and interpretation. Your enthusiasm for the subject really shines through, which is fantastic to see. However, there are some areas where clarity and coherence could be improved to make your arguments more compelling.

One of the strengths of your essay is your focus on specific details from the story. You mention various paragraphs and their content, which shows you're engaging with the text. However, the way you connect these details to your main argument could be clearer. Some of your sentences feel a bit disjointed and could benefit from smoother transitions. This would help your reader follow your thoughts more easily. 

When it comes to your argument, you make some interesting points about the differences between the original Mona Lisa and the computer-generated image. However, it would be more effective if you elaborated on why these details matter. For example, what does Mona Lisa's smile represent? Why is it significant to her character or the art itself? Incorporating this kind of analysis would strengthen your argument and provide a deeper understanding for your readers.

In terms of writing competency, you're showing good potential, but there are areas that need refinement. Your vocabulary is solid, but there are some spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your message. For instance, ""accomplishing"" and ""original"" need correction. Additionally, varying your sentence structure can really enhance your writing style; right now, many of your sentences start similarly, which can feel repetitive.

Since you seem interested in the topic, I recommend spending some time revising your essay with a focus on clarity. Start by outlining your main points more clearly before diving into the details. Try to explain the significance of your observations in a way that connects back to your thesis. Reading your essay out loud can also help you catch awkward phrasing and ensure that your ideas flow logically.

In your next draft, consider asking yourself: What do I want my reader to take away from this? How can I make my insights more engaging? By addressing these questions, you'll be able to elevate your writing and make your points resonate even more. Keep it up—I'm looking forward to seeing how your writing evolves!"

Your essay presents an interesting topic about technology that reads emotional expressions, and it has the potential to spark engaging discussions. However, there are several areas where your writing could be improved to make your ideas clearer and more compelling.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject matter, and it’s clear that you have a basic understanding of how technology can analyze emotions. The reference to the Mona Lisa is a great choice, as it helps illustrate your point. However, the essay feels a bit scattered. For instance, some sentences are difficult to follow due to grammar issues and awkward phrasing. This can distract your readers from your main ideas. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the interesting examples you chose, especially the mention of the Mona Lisa’s smile. It connects the historical with the technological, which is a unique angle. However, the areas for improvement are numerous. Firstly, there are grammatical errors, such as “fro” instead of “for,” and “consturucts” instead of “constructs.” Additionally, the structure could be more organized, with clearer transitions between your ideas. Clarifying your points and eliminating run-on sentences would also enhance readability.

Your argument about how computers can differentiate between real and fake smiles is intriguing, but it could be more persuasive with additional evidence or explanations. For example, you could elaborate on how this technology is applied in real-life situations beyond just the Mona Lisa. Also, consider exploring the implications of this technology: what does it mean for human interactions? How might it affect relationships? Adding depth to your examples can strengthen your argument.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a good understanding of the topic, but there are noticeable weaknesses in grammar and sentence structure. Your enthusiasm for the topic is great, but it’s essential to focus on clarity and coherence. Working on your proofreading skills will help you catch those pesky mistakes that can detract from your message. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend revising for grammar and clarity. Focus on constructing more concise sentences and ensuring that your ideas flow logically from one to the next. You might also want to incorporate more examples and evidence to strengthen your argument. Finally, consider reading your essay aloud to help identify awkward phrasing or unclear sections. This can be a helpful technique to refine your writing and ensure your ideas are communicated effectively. Keep up your interest in the topic, and use this feedback to develop your writing skills further!"

Your essay presents an interesting and personal perspective on the topic of conspiracy theories, particularly regarding the ""face on Mars."" It captures a relatable sibling dynamic, which adds a personal touch and makes the narrative engaging. However, there are areas that could use some polishing to enhance clarity and depth.

Overall, I found your piece to be a lively depiction of a conversation with your sister, showcasing the absurdity and stubbornness often found in discussions about conspiracy theories. The dialogue is engaging and gives a glimpse into your relationship, which is a strong aspect of your writing. However, the narrative could benefit from a clearer structure and more context about the significance of the argument. Right now, it feels a bit disjointed and could use transitions to guide the reader through your thoughts and experiences more smoothly.

One of the strengths of your essay is the conversational tone, which draws the reader in. Your use of dialogue effectively conveys the passion and frustration of your interactions with your sister. However, some areas need improvement, particularly in grammar and punctuation. There are several run-on sentences and instances where punctuation could be better utilized to enhance readability. Additionally, providing more background information about the ""face on Mars"" and why it’s significant could lend your argument more weight.

In terms of argument evaluation, while you present a clear stance against your sister’s beliefs, the essay lacks a deeper exploration of the reasons behind her views or the implications of such conspiracy thinking. Adding more examples or discussing the psychology behind belief in conspiracy theories could strengthen your argument. It might also help to include some external evidence or references to studies that discuss why people cling to such beliefs, which would enhance your credibility.

Your writing style shows promise, especially in how you convey character and emotion through dialogue. However, you could work on tightening your sentences and improving overall clarity. Pay attention to sentence fragments and run-ons; breaking them into shorter, more concise sentences can help make your points more impactful. Also, try to vary your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.

Since you seem to have a personal interest in the topic, consider exploring broader themes around belief and skepticism. This could not only enrich your essay but also provide a more nuanced perspective on your sister's views. 

To make your writing more effective, I recommend revising for clarity and flow. Start by organizing your thoughts more cohesively, perhaps outlining the key points you want to make before diving into writing. This will help you create a logical progression in your narrative. Additionally, consider incorporating more context or research about the ""face on Mars"" to add depth to your arguments. Lastly, don't shy away from proofreading for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing; it can make a world of difference in how your essay is received. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you refine your ideas!"

I appreciate your creativity and enthusiasm in tackling such a fascinating topic! It's clear you have a vivid imagination and a knack for storytelling, which adds a lively touch to your essay. However, there are some areas where clarity and structure could enhance your message.

One of the strengths of your essay is the engaging narrative style. You’ve created a scenario that draws readers in, making them curious about the mysterious mask on Mars. The dialogue between you and Christina adds a fun element and showcases differing perspectives. However, the essay could benefit from a more organized structure. Right now, the flow feels a bit choppy, and some sentences are confusing due to grammatical errors and unclear phrasing. For example, mixing up ""me and Christina"" with ""Christina and I"" would strengthen your writing. Additionally, be careful with spelling—“obvious” and “she” need some attention.

When evaluating your argument, it's interesting to see how you present both sides regarding the mask on Mars. You reference factual information, which is great, but it seems like your conclusion veers off into a summary rather than a strong closing argument. You could dive deeper into why these differing viewpoints matter or reflect on the implications of believing in extraterrestrial life versus understanding natural formations. 

In terms of your writing ability, you're off to a good start, but there are definitely areas to polish. Your style is engaging, but clarity is crucial. Strengths include your imaginative approach and ability to present dialogue, while weaknesses lie in grammar and coherence. I recommend focusing on sentence structure and punctuation in your revisions. Reading your essay out loud could help you catch awkward phrases and errors.

To enhance your essay, consider outlining your main points before writing. This will help you maintain a clear focus throughout. Also, try to incorporate smoother transitions between your ideas. You might want to research more about Martian landforms to provide a stronger factual basis for your argument. Finally, don’t hesitate to share your thoughts on the implications of those differing beliefs more deeply, as that could add depth to your conclusion. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your writing further!"
F15,"I am against this new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System. It seems like it doesn't really work and they just make things up. I don't see how it could actually work like that.

You just can't say ""Oh this person looks really happy all the time"" Well maybe their not happy all the time. Maybe their not happy at all.

The text states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Maybe that's her happy face or maybe it's her ""I'm going to kill you face"". Who knows. All we know is that she looks happy. Somewhat happy. It's not like she's around to tell you what she was feeling then.

Your essay presents a strong personal stance against the Facial Action Coding System, which is a great starting point. It’s clear that you have strong feelings about this technology and its effectiveness. However, your argument could be strengthened with a bit more structure and clarity. 

Overall, I appreciate your engagement with the topic and the way you express skepticism. It’s refreshing to see a voice that challenges new technologies rather than simply accepting them. Your informal style adds a personal touch, which can make your argument relatable. However, the essay would benefit from a clearer organization of your points. Right now, it reads more like a stream of consciousness than a structured argument, making it somewhat difficult to follow your reasoning at times.

One of the strengths of your essay is your use of real-life examples, like the reference to the 83 percent happy face. This adds a relatable context to your argument. But it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or evidence to support your claims. For instance, if you have any data or studies that highlight the limitations of the Facial Action Coding System, including them could give your argument more credibility. 

Your writing style is conversational and engaging, which is a plus, especially for this topic. However, there are some weaknesses in clarity and coherence that you might want to address. For example, your sentences could be more concise, and sometimes your ideas feel a bit jumbled. Try to focus on one point at a time and make sure to connect your thoughts clearly, which would help guide your reader through your argument.

Since you seem interested in technology and how it impacts human interaction, I recommend diving deeper into research about the Facial Action Coding System and similar technologies. This could provide you with more concrete examples and arguments to bolster your essay. 

To enhance your writing, consider outlining your main points before diving into the drafting phase. This way, you can ensure each paragraph has a clear purpose and contributes to your overall argument. Additionally, revising your essay for grammar and sentence structure will improve the flow of your writing. 

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build upon, and with a little more organization and support for your arguments, your essay could be even more compelling. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas further!"

Overall, your essay shows an interesting perspective on the Mona Lisa and the fascination surrounding her emotions. You've chosen a captivating subject, and I appreciate your attempt to explore the various interpretations of her smile through technological advancements. This is a unique angle that could resonate with readers.

One strength of your essay is that you bring up a fascinating topic that many find intriguing—the emotions of the Mona Lisa. You’ve made a commendable effort to connect modern technology with historical art. However, there are several areas for improvement. Your essay lacks a clear structure; the introduction, body, and conclusion feel somewhat disconnected. Also, clarity is an issue, as some sentences are difficult to understand, and there are grammatical errors that detract from your message. I encourage you to take a step back and think about how to organize your thoughts more coherently.

Regarding your argument and examples, you touch on an interesting point about the different emotions of the Mona Lisa, but it would be beneficial to provide more specific examples and deeper analysis. For instance, mentioning who studied her emotions, what specific technology was used, and how these findings contribute to the overall understanding of the artwork would strengthen your claims. Right now, your argument feels a bit vague and could use more concrete details to support it.

In terms of your writing ability, you have a good grasp of the topic, which shows your interest in the Mona Lisa and her significance in art history. However, there are weaknesses in your writing style that need attention. Your sentences often lack clarity, and there are grammatical issues that hinder your ability to convey your ideas effectively. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on sentence structure and clarity. Try to break down complex ideas into simpler sentences, and ensure that each sentence contributes clearly to your argument. Reading your essay out loud could help you identify awkward phrasing or confusing sections. Additionally, consider creating an outline before writing to help organize your thoughts logically. 

To enhance the essay, be sure to introduce your thesis more clearly in the introduction, and ensure that each body paragraph supports that thesis with clear evidence and examples. Make sure to proofread your work for grammar and clarity, and don’t hesitate to seek feedback from peers or teachers before finalizing your draft. Your interest in this topic is clear, and with some focused effort, I believe you can create a compelling piece!"

Your essay offers some intriguing thoughts on the ""Mona Lisa,"" but it feels a bit disorganized and could benefit from clearer articulation of your ideas. It’s clear that you have a personal connection to the artwork and an interest in exploring the emotions behind it, which is a great starting point. However, the way these thoughts come together could use more polish.

One of the strengths of your essay is your attempt to analyze the emotional undertones of the painting. You bring up interesting points about the mood of the subject and how you perceive her expression. This shows that you’re engaging with the art on a personal level. However, the essay could be improved by structuring your ideas more clearly and providing more specific examples to support your claims. For instance, rather than general comments about the colors and atmosphere, you might focus on specific elements in the painting that evoke certain feelings. 

Your argument about the mood of the ""Mona Lisa"" is compelling, but it could be clearer and more focused. When you mention her ""slightly smile"" and ""evil eye,"" it would help to elaborate on how these expressions connect to the overall theme you are discussing. Additionally, proofread your work for grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, as these can distract from your message. Phrases like ""its like a slightly smile"" could be rephrased for better clarity.

In terms of your writing ability, you show potential but need to work on clarity and coherence. Your style has a conversational tone, which can be engaging, but be cautious about informal language that may not fit the academic context. You have a strong ability to express your personal views, which is a strength, but you'll want to refine how you present those ideas on paper. 

To help develop your writing, I recommend taking the time to outline your thoughts before you start writing. This will help you organize your ideas and create a logical flow. Also, practicing your grammar and sentence structure will enhance the readability of your essays. Consider reading more academic articles on art analysis to see how you can frame your arguments and support them with evidence effectively.

Overall, your interest in the topic is evident, and with some focused effort on structure and clarity, you can elevate your writing significantly. Keep exploring your thoughts on art, and don’t hesitate to dig deeper into the specifics of what you see and feel."
F-M3,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. He did not want to smile for the camra and so he did not he had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because he could not smile, he did not want to. That was the case he did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give his a smile. So they came up with a way and got his a smile for the photo and now he is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that he would just smile but he would not have it and so they had to give his a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want his smile so they made a program and copywrited his smile and made it fake. Like they said ""he was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things.

I appreciate your effort in tackling a complex subject like the Mona Lisa and the emotions behind it. You’ve come up with a unique angle, exploring the idea of using technology to interpret and alter emotions in art. It’s clear you have an interest in blending art with modern technology, which is a fascinating theme! 

However, the essay feels a bit disjointed and hard to follow at times. Your main idea about the Mona Lisa and the computer program is interesting, but it gets lost in some confusing phrasing and grammatical issues. For example, you mix up subjects and pronouns, like when you say “his a smile” instead of “her smile.” These kinds of errors can distract from your main points and make it hard for readers to understand what you're trying to say. 

One strength of your essay is that you attempt to incorporate specific details, such as mentioning Thomas Huang and his software. However, you could strengthen your argument by connecting these details more clearly to your main thesis. For instance, when you discuss the percentage of emotions that the Mona Lisa supposedly embodies, it would be helpful to explain how this data relates to the painting’s historical context or its significance in art history. 

In terms of writing competency, you show a willingness to engage with the material, but your writing style needs more clarity and structure. Right now, it feels a bit scattered; focusing on smoother transitions between ideas would help your essay flow better. 

To improve, I recommend revisiting the main points of your argument and outlining your ideas before writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure each point supports your thesis. Additionally, pay close attention to grammar and punctuation; tools like grammar checkers can be really helpful. It might also be beneficial to read your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or errors. 

With a bit more refinement and focus, your writing can become much clearer and more compelling. Keep exploring this interesting intersection of technology and art!"

First off, I appreciate the creative effort you've put into this story! It has an intriguing premise with a father-son dynamic and hints at adventure that can really engage readers. The dialogue adds a nice touch, giving life to the characters and their interactions. However, the execution needs significant improvement to enhance clarity and coherence.

One of the main strengths of your essay is the conversational tone. The dialogue feels authentic, and it captures the playful yet tense relationship between the characters. It’s clear you have some interesting ideas about family dynamics and personal history. That said, there are quite a few areas that need improvement. The narrative jumps around a bit, which can confuse readers. It's essential to have a clear structure and flow to keep the audience engaged. Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors, like “enturupted” instead of “interrupted” and “daugter” for “daughter.” These mistakes can distract from your storytelling and make it harder for readers to grasp your message.

Regarding the argument and use of examples, while you introduce some interesting themes, they don't fully develop within the story. The father's past as a “wave surfer” or a “guy on a cattle boat” is intriguing but lacks depth. If you expanded on these experiences or provided more context about why they matter to the characters, it would strengthen your narrative. Right now, the story feels a bit disjointed, as if it’s a collection of ideas rather than a cohesive narrative.

In terms of writing competency and style, you're on the right track with your dialogue and character interactions. However, your writing would benefit from improved grammar and sentence structure. There are instances where ideas are not fully expressed, making it hard to understand the plot. Focus on clarity—try to form complete thoughts and ensure that your sentences flow logically from one to the next. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend taking the time to revise. Read through your work and look for ways to clarify your ideas. You might consider outlining your story before writing or breaking it into sections to ensure it has a logical progression. Pay attention to spelling and grammatical details; tools like spell check can be really helpful. Lastly, think about deepening your characters' backgrounds and motivations. What drives the father to tell his stories? How does his past shape his relationship with his son? Adding these layers will create a more compelling narrative.

Keep writing and revising! You've got great ideas, and with some polishing, they can really shine."
F-M5,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

Overall, your essay presents an interesting perspective on the emotions depicted in the Mona Lisa, and I appreciate your effort to challenge the conventional interpretations. You offer a unique take on how emotions can be misrepresented or misunderstood based solely on facial expressions. However, the overall clarity of your argument suffers due to some structural issues and grammatical errors.

One of the strengths of your writing is your engagement with the topic. It’s evident that you have put thought into your disagreement with the author's interpretation of the painting. Your insights about facial expressions and the limitations of interpreting emotions through art are valuable and show a deeper level of critical thinking. However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from clearer organization, as some of your points feel a bit scattered. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your overall message. For instance, ""wasnt"" should be ""wasn't,"" and ""expiriencing"" should be ""experiencing."" These mistakes can undermine the credibility of your argument.

When it comes to your argument, while you raise intriguing points, it would strengthen your case to include more specific examples or references to support your claims. For instance, you mention that ""faces don’t lie,"" yet you assert that emotions can be faked. Expanding on this contradiction with examples or further explanation could clarify your stance. Also, discussing how different cultures interpret facial expressions might add depth to your argument.

In terms of writing competency, your style shows a personal voice, which is a great asset. However, your essay would benefit from a bit more polish in terms of sentence structure and grammar. There are moments where your ideas get a bit jumbled, making it hard for the reader to follow your train of thought. Focusing on sentence variety and ensuring each sentence contributes to your main argument could help.

To enhance your essay, I recommend outlining your main points before writing to improve the flow and coherence of your argument. Paying closer attention to grammar and spelling will also make your writing more professional and readable. Finally, consider diving deeper into the context of the painting or incorporating a few scholarly references to support your ideas. This will not only strengthen your argument but also show your engagement with existing literature on the topic.

Keep up the passion for exploring such fascinating subjects! You clearly have a strong interest in art and emotion, and with some refinement, your writing can truly shine."
F-M6,"I am against it. The people that show no emotion do it for a reason.

Most likely people show no emotion on their face becasue they don't want people to know how they feel. It gives people the hint saying i don't want to talk to you or just leave me alone.

Some students tend to be closed off from people and that's how they like it and want to be left alone. It's most likely the ones that don't show emotion had a bad past, something horrible happened recently and don't want people to find out, Etc. For example, a boy recently moved in with his father after 16 years living with his father. He wanted a new change so he left but what people don't know is that he cries at night for leaving his other siblings and father etc. He wouldn't want people to know how he really feels, so he hides it away showing no emotion or having a fake emotion on his face. He doesn't want anyone to know what's going on in his life or just doesn't want people in his buisness.

That is why we shouldn't use the new technology of indentifying emotions on people that obviously dont't want to. Not everybody is the same , has a good life like others or a bad one. Also, just because someone is bored the computer that can identify emotions shouldn't try to make the next thing they watch or do more fun for them. In the real world you go through things that is as boring as looking at a wall all day. So, they shouldn't get used to everything being fun because it's not.   ","

Your stance against using technology to identify emotions is clear, and you delve into the reasons behind why some people might choose to hide their feelings. However, there are areas where your argument could be strengthened and your writing could use some polishing.

Your overall impression of the topic is compelling, and I appreciate the personal touch you added with the example of the boy and his emotional struggles. It shows that you have a good grasp of the complexities surrounding emotional expression. However, your essay feels a bit disjointed at times. You have valuable points, but they could flow together more smoothly. It would help to create stronger transitions between your ideas to guide the reader through your thought process.

One of your strengths is your ability to empathize with individuals who might be struggling emotionally. You demonstrate an understanding that not everyone has the same experiences, which adds depth to your argument. However, there are areas for improvement. For instance, try to ensure your spelling and grammar are spot on—there are some small mistakes, like “buisness” and “dont't,” that can be distracting. Additionally, while your example is poignant, it could benefit from more detail to enhance the emotional impact.

Your argument is thought-provoking, and you make a valid case for why technology shouldn't interfere with personal emotional expression. However, it could be even stronger if you provided more evidence or examples to support your claims. For instance, you might consider including research or statistics that show how technology can misinterpret emotions or cases where it has led to misunderstandings.

Regarding your writing ability, you show promise but need to refine your style. Your voice is clear and direct, which is great, but try to vary your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. Additionally, work on your punctuation and grammar to improve clarity. Sometimes, simple errors can undermine the strength of your ideas.

To develop your skills further, consider reading more essays or articles on similar topics. Pay attention to how authors structure their arguments and use transitions. Also, practice revising your work for clarity and coherence. It might help to have someone else read your essay to catch any mistakes you might have missed.

In summary, your essay has a solid foundation, and your passion for the subject shines through. By focusing on improving the flow of your writing, enhancing your argument with more examples, and polishing your grammar, you can elevate your essay to the next level. Keep writing and exploring your thoughts on this topic—you have a lot of potential!"
F-M7,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that he was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if he's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with his at that time of the picture you would never know how he's feeling.

I appreciate the effort you put into discussing the Facial Coding System and how it relates to understanding emotions. It's clear that you are passionate about the topic and have put thought into your argument. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization and more precise language to better convey your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your strong opinion on the limitations of the Facial Coding System. You effectively express your belief that emotions can only be fully understood through personal interaction. This is an interesting perspective and could lead to a more engaging discussion if you explore it further. However, the essay would be much stronger if you provided more structure. The ideas seem to flow somewhat chaotically. Breaking your argument into clear points, supported by examples, would make it easier for the reader to follow your reasoning. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, like ""perent"" instead of ""percent"" and ""andd"" instead of ""and,"" which can distract from your argument.

Your argument is valid, but it could be bolstered by including specific examples or studies that support your viewpoint. For instance, you mention the Mona Lisa painting, but elaborating on how art interpretation can vary depending on context would strengthen your case. Perhaps you could also contrast the Facial Coding System with other methods of understanding emotions, such as verbal communication or body language. This would not only clarify your argument but also demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.

In terms of writing competency, your style shows potential, but it needs refinement. The flow of your essay can be improved by organizing your thoughts more clearly and using complete sentences. You have the foundation of a good argument, but it sometimes gets lost in the way you express it. 

To enhance your writing, try to outline your essay before you start. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that each point is clearly developed. Additionally, consider revising your work for grammar and spelling errors before submitting. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve the overall flow. It might also be helpful to engage with more resources on the topic, as this can provide you with additional examples and strengthen your argument.

Overall, I can see that you are interested in the topic and have the potential to make a compelling argument. With some revisions and a more structured approach, your essay could be much more impactful. Keep up the effort and continue refining your writing skills!"
F-M8,"Imagine a man is late to work and his hair is a mess, he threw random clothees on, and all his work papers are stored in random places in his briefcase. But if he owns a driverless car, the man could sort out his paper files, fix his hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the mentleman in the story has a regular car, who knows if he will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that he will be, and he will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or he is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or he for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the man in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the man probably have gotten into a car crash because he was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the mentleman did have a driverless car, he would have been on time for work and he would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents.

Your essay tackles a fascinating and contemporary topic: driverless cars. The way you connected the story of a late man with the benefits of driverless technology showcases your ability to think creatively. I appreciate the effort you put into discussing the potential safety features of these vehicles, which is a crucial aspect of why many people are excited about this technology.

One of the strengths of your essay is the use of examples. You referenced passages that support your points, which is a good way to add credibility to your argument. However, I noticed some areas where clarity can be improved. For example, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""clothees"" instead of ""clothes,"" and ""mentleman"" instead of ""gentleman."" These mistakes can distract readers from your message. Additionally, the organization of your thoughts could be clearer. Sometimes your points feel a bit jumbled, making it hard for the reader to follow your line of reasoning.

Your argument about the positive impact of driverless cars is compelling, but it could use more depth. While you mentioned safety features, it would be beneficial to explore other aspects, like how driverless cars could affect traffic patterns or reduce emissions. Furthermore, the references to movies like Transformers, while relatable, might not be the strongest evidence for your argument. Instead, consider using more real-world examples or statistics that can further support your claims.

In terms of writing competency, you show potential but need to work on clarity and precision. Your voice is coming through, which is great, but it’s important to refine your expression. Pay attention to sentence structure and punctuation to enhance readability. I suggest reading your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or errors. 

To further develop your writing, consider outlining your main points before you start. This can help organize your thoughts and provide a clearer path for your argument. Additionally, after drafting your essay, take the time to proofread it or even have someone else review it. This will help catch those pesky spelling and grammar mistakes.

Overall, your interest in driverless technology shines through, and with some focused improvements, I believe you can produce an even stronger essay. Keep exploring this topic and refining your writing skills!"
F-M9,"The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results.

In the first paragraph its states he is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because he is smiling, he couldve been fearful because he didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and he couldve been angery because at the time he wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint his facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face he made in the painting.

I appreciate your effort in tackling a fascinating topic that blends art and technology. Your essay shows a genuine curiosity about how modern technology can be applied to historical works like the Mona Lisa. It’s clear you’re interested in the subject, and that enthusiasm can be a great foundation for deeper exploration. However, the overall clarity and organization of your essay could use some work to better convey your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your engagement with the topic. You brought in the idea of the Facial Action Coding System, which is a relevant and interesting point. However, your writing would benefit from clearer structure and more coherent arguments. Some of your sentences are a bit jumbled, making it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts. For example, the transition between discussing the emotions of Mona Lisa and the Facial Action Coding System could be smoother. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors—correcting these would strengthen your overall presentation.

Your argument touches on the emotional interpretation of Mona Lisa's expression, which is a thought-provoking angle. However, the evidence you provide could be more effectively articulated. You mention percentages of emotions but don’t explain where these figures come from or how they relate to your argument. Including specific details about the studies or technology you reference could lend more credibility to your claims. Expanding on how the Facial Action Coding System works and providing a bit of context about its application would also enhance your essay.

When it comes to your writing style, I see some potential. You have a conversational tone that makes your writing approachable, which is a big plus. However, you need to work on sentence structure and grammar to improve clarity. For instance, be mindful of typos and punctuation—these small details can significantly impact your writing's professionalism. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend reading more essays on similar topics to see how others structure their arguments and present their ideas. Pay attention to how they use evidence and examples to support their claims. It may also be helpful to outline your thoughts before writing to ensure a logical flow of ideas from one paragraph to the next. Finally, consider revising your work more carefully before submitting to catch any spelling or grammatical mistakes.

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build on, and with some revisions and focused practice, I believe you can improve your writing significantly. Keep exploring this intriguing intersection of technology and art!"
F-M10,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

He also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, he uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

He explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, he was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing his readers that his original claim is supported.

This essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the challenges and potential rewards of studying Venus. Your engagement with the topic is clear, and you’ve done well to outline the arguments made by the author of “The Challenge of Exploring Venus.” The way you summarize the author’s points shows you have a good grasp of the material and the central argument being made.

One of the major strengths of your essay is how you highlight the balance between the dangers of exploring Venus and the potential scientific gains. You effectively summarize the author’s claims and provide a coherent narrative that reflects your understanding. However, there are areas that could use improvement. For instance, while you mention specific paragraphs and points from the original piece, the essay could benefit from deeper analysis. Instead of just summarizing, consider discussing the implications of those ideas or how they connect to broader themes in space exploration. 

You present a solid argument and use relevant examples, like NASA's plans for exploration, which strengthen your case. However, there are moments where the connection between the dangers and the proposed solutions could be made clearer. For instance, when discussing the blimp-like vehicle, you could elaborate on how this innovative approach contrasts with traditional methods of exploration. This would give your argument more depth and make it more compelling.

In terms of your writing style, you have a clear voice that reflects your interest in the topic, which is fantastic. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and typos, such as “30 or so milles” and “counditions.” Paying attention to such details will enhance the professionalism of your writing. Additionally, varying your sentence structure can make your essay more engaging. 

To continue developing your writing skills, I recommend practicing more critical analysis. Instead of simply stating the author’s points, challenge them or discuss their significance in a broader context. This will help elevate your writing from a summary to a more nuanced interpretation. Also, consider proofreading your work for minor errors; this can make a big difference in how your essay is perceived.

Overall, you have a strong foundation here. With a bit more depth in your analysis and attention to detail, you can take your writing to the next level. Keep up the good work!"

Overall, your essay presents an interesting take on the topic of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile Again."" There’s a clear attempt to discuss the emotional aspects of the painting and the technical details of how a computer model might improve upon the original. However, the ideas come across as a bit disorganized and could benefit from clearer articulation.

One of the strengths of your writing is your engagement with the subject matter. You show a genuine interest in the emotional expression of the Mona Lisa, which is a fascinating topic! However, the essay could be greatly improved by focusing on clarity and coherence. Right now, some of your arguments are a bit muddled, making it hard to follow your main points. For example, the connection between the computer model and the original painting could be more explicitly stated. Also, be careful with grammar and spelling, as errors can distract from your ideas.

When it comes to your argument and examples, you’ve got the right idea by referencing specific paragraphs, but the explanations feel a bit vague. It would help to elaborate on why the changes in the computer model make a difference to Mona Lisa’s expression or how that affects the viewer's interpretation. Your points need to be supported with clearer evidence or examples that connect back to your thesis.

In terms of writing style and competency, there’s a solid foundation here, but it feels like you’re still working through some of the basics. Your vocabulary is appropriate for the topic, but you might want to work on sentence structure and flow. Aim for smoother transitions between your ideas so that the reader can follow along more easily. 

To develop your writing further, consider spending some time on outlining your main points before you start writing. This can help you maintain a clear structure throughout your essay. Also, revising for grammar and punctuation will make your arguments more persuasive. Reading your work aloud or having someone else look over it can also reveal areas where your ideas might be unclear.

Overall, you’ve taken a creative approach to an intriguing subject, but with a bit more focus and organization in your writing, you can really enhance your essay. Keep exploring these ideas, and don’t hesitate to dig deeper into your analysis!"

I appreciate your effort in exploring the fascinating topic of technology that reads emotional expressions. You've chosen an intriguing subject that is relevant and engaging. However, the essay could benefit from more clarity and organization to effectively convey your thoughts. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the choice of example—the Mona Lisa is a classic and compelling case to illustrate how the technology works. You effectively point out that different emotions can be detected from facial expressions, which is a key aspect of this technology. However, your arguments could be more coherent. For instance, some sentences are a bit jumbled, making it hard to follow your train of thought. Consider breaking down your ideas more clearly and ensuring that each sentence logically follows the one before it.

Your argument has potential, but it would be even stronger with more detailed explanations and examples. For instance, you mention how computers can distinguish between a real and a fake smile, but you don't elaborate on how this is done. Providing a specific example or a brief explanation of the technology behind it could significantly enhance your credibility and engage your reader further. Additionally, clarifying how this technology can be applied beyond just the Mona Lisa would give your conclusion more impact and relevance.

Regarding your writing style, I see that you have a genuine interest in the subject matter, which is fantastic. However, your writing would benefit from a bit more polish. There are several spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""fro"" instead of ""for,"" ""articule"" instead of ""article,"" and issues with verb tenses, like ""he has detected"" instead of ""it has detected."" These mistakes can distract from your message, so make sure to proofread your work or use tools that can help catch these errors.

To improve your writing, I recommend focusing on sentence structure and grammar. Breaking longer sentences into shorter, clearer ones can greatly enhance readability. Additionally, consider creating an outline before writing to help organize your thoughts. This will allow you to ensure that your ideas flow logically from one to the next. Finally, don't hesitate to dive deeper into examples and explanations, as this will not only strengthen your argument but also make your writing more engaging and informative.

Keep exploring this fascinating topic; there's so much more to discover, and your passion for it will shine through in your future essays!"

I appreciate the effort you put into this essay! It’s clear that you have a personal connection to the topic, especially with the portrayal of your brother’s conspiracy theories. The dialogue adds a dynamic element to your writing, allowing readers to engage with the back-and-forth nature of your conversation. 

One of your strengths is the conversational tone you’ve adopted, which makes the piece relatable and engaging. It feels like a genuine interaction, and that adds a layer of authenticity to your writing. However, the essay could benefit from greater organization. The ideas sometimes feel scattered, making it difficult to follow your main point. It might help to have a clearer structure—perhaps starting with the argument, then the dialogue, and finally your reflections on it.

You did a good job illustrating your brother's steadfastness in his beliefs, but the argument could be strengthened with more evidence or context. I would suggest integrating some background information on the ""face on Mars"" phenomenon or discussing why such conspiracy theories persist. It would provide readers with a broader understanding and could help ground your brother's views in a context that can be analyzed more critically.

Your writing style shows promise, but there are some areas for improvement. Firstly, watch out for typos and grammatical errors, such as “his” instead of “him” and “someone” instead of “somone.” These small mistakes can detract from the overall quality of your writing. Additionally, varying your sentence structure could enhance the flow; sometimes, short, punchy sentences can create a more impactful rhythm. 

Since you seem interested in the topic, consider diving deeper into the psychology behind conspiracy theories. This could not only enrich your essay but also help you explore your brother’s perspective more thoroughly. 

To elevate your essay, I recommend outlining your main points before writing. This could help you stay focused on your argument and ensure your examples are well-integrated. Also, consider revising for clarity and cohesion, as this will enhance the reader's experience. Keep writing and refining your style; you’re on the right track!"

I appreciate the creativity and imagination you brought to this essay! The topic of discovering something mysterious on Mars is intriguing, and it shows your interest in space exploration and the unknown. Your essay presents a dynamic conversation between you and Christina, which adds a personal touch. However, there are several areas where you could strengthen your writing to make your argument clearer and more compelling.

One of the strengths of your essay is the engaging narrative style. It feels like a story, drawing readers into your thoughts and dialogue with Christina. The contrast between your views and Christina's adds a fun dynamic! However, the essay could benefit from clearer structure and organization. You have some good ideas, but they can get a bit muddled. Try to stick to one main idea per paragraph and make sure each thought flows logically into the next. Additionally, watch out for grammar and punctuation errors, as these can distract readers from your message.

In terms of argument and examples, you present an interesting debate about whether the mask is a natural formation or a sign of alien life. However, the evidence you use could be strengthened. You mention NASA's clarification about the image, which is a great point! Yet, the way you’ve integrated it feels a bit abrupt. Consider connecting your thoughts more smoothly and explaining why this evidence supports your position. It might also help to elaborate on both perspectives a bit more before concluding with the NASA statement. This way, readers can understand the full scope of the debate before you provide resolution.

Looking at your writing ability, it's clear that you have a good grasp of storytelling and personal expression, which are great skills in writing. However, there are some weaknesses in grammar, punctuation, and clarity. For instance, phrases like ""me and my partner"" should use ""my partner and I,"" and there are several spelling errors throughout that need to be fixed. To improve, consider reading your essay out loud to catch errors or confusing phrases. Also, try to practice varying your sentence structure for more engaging reading.

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic of space and exploration, why not dive even deeper? Research more about Mars or similar discoveries to enrich your essay. You could include more facts or anecdotes about space exploration to bolster your argument. Additionally, consider working on your proofreading skills. Taking the time to review your work before submitting it can help you catch those little mistakes that can make a big difference.

Overall, you have a solid foundation, and with some revisions and attention to detail, your writing can shine even brighter! Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop this essay further."
F-M15,"I am against this new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System. It seems like it doesn't really work and they just make things up. I don't see how it could actually work like that. You can almost never what a person is feeling based on their facial expressions because some people have masks. You just can't say ""Oh this person looks really happy all the time"" Well maybe their not happy all the time. Maybe their not happy at all.

The text states ""He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Maybe that's his happy face or maybe it's his ""I'm going to kill you face"". Who knows. All we know is that he looks happy. Somewhat happy. It's not like he's around to tell you what he was feeling then. Maybe he was just trying to looks ugly for da Vinci because maybe he had a thing for his and he wasn't interested in an artist.

The text also states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Okay, I can probably agree to that. But still, computers that can calculate expressions seems a little futuristic to me. Maybe in 15-20 years that would be the coolest thing ever but right now, it just seems like people are trying too hard for a big new invention.

Your essay presents a strong opinion against the Facial Action Coding System, and I appreciate your willingness to question new technology. It’s clear that you have a unique perspective, and you’re not afraid to express it. Exploring the limitations of this technology shows critical thinking, and your informal tone makes the essay feel personal and relatable.

One of the strengths of your writing is your engaging voice. You have a conversational style that draws the reader in, and your humor adds a nice touch. However, there are areas where you can improve. The organization of your thoughts could be clearer. It feels a bit scattered at times, which makes it hard for the reader to follow your main points. Additionally, some phrases could benefit from a little more clarity. For instance, when you mention “trying to looks ugly for da Vinci,” it’s a bit confusing and could use some elaboration or context. 

Your argument is interesting, but it would be stronger if you provided more evidence or examples to support your claims. While you mention that facial expressions can be misleading, exploring specific studies or real-life instances where this has been the case would strengthen your argument. Your point about humans calculating expressions is valid, yet it could use more depth. Perhaps you could explain how humans do this compared to computers. This would help to illustrate your skepticism about the technology more effectively.

In terms of writing ability, your style is engaging, which is a definite plus. You have a knack for making your writing feel lively, which keeps the reader interested. However, your essay could benefit from more structured paragraphs. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea, which will help in making your argument more coherent. Also, watch out for typos—like “technolgy” and “looks” instead of “look.” These small errors can distract from your overall message.

Given that you seem to have a strong interest in this topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into research. Look for articles or studies that discuss the effectiveness of facial recognition technology or the psychology behind facial expressions. This will not only help you build a solid foundation for your argument but also enhance your credibility as a writer.

To enhance your essay, consider creating an outline before you start writing. This can help you organize your thoughts more clearly. Focus on providing specific examples or data to back up your claims, and don’t shy away from expanding on your ideas. Lastly, proofreading your work will help catch those pesky typos and improve the overall polish of your writing. Keep at it; you have great potential!"
