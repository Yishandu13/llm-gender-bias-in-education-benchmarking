**Evaluation:**
This essay presents a clear enthusiasm for the subject matter, specifically regarding Luke's desire to join the program and become a Seagoing Cowboy. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement. The ideas are repetitive and lack depth, and the writing suffers from numerous spelling and grammatical errors that make it difficult to follow. 

**Feedback:**

1. **Structure and Organization**: The essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Consider starting with a strong introduction that outlines your main argument. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea that supports your thesis.

2. **Clarity and Development of Ideas**: While you express that Luke wants to join the program, the reasons provided are vague and repetitive. Try to expand on why the program is beneficial for him. For example, what specific skills or experiences does he hope to gain? Providing concrete examples will strengthen your argument.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are many spelling mistakes (e.g., ""actullay,"" ""dissions,"" ""hie,"" ""clollege"") and grammatical issues (e.g., run-on sentences, incorrect capitalization). Proofreading your work before submission can help catch these errors. Consider using tools like spell check or asking a peer to review your work.

4. **Use of Evidence**: You mention ""some detail from this article,"" but you don't provide any specific examples or references. Incorporating evidence from sources can support your claims and make your argument more persuasive.

5. **Voice and Tone**: While it's great that you convey enthusiasm for your subject, the tone can be more formal. Avoid casual phrases like ""ain't nobody"" in academic writing. Aim for a tone that reflects seriousness and thoughtfulness.

6. **Conclusion**: Your essay lacks a concluding paragraph that summarizes your main points and reinforces your argument. A strong conclusion can leave a lasting impression on your reader.

**Next Steps**: I recommend revising your essay with these points in mind. Focus on creating a clear structure, developing your ideas more thoroughly, and proofreading for grammatical accuracy. This will help enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek help if needed!"
M2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for your submission. You have presented some interesting points regarding why Luke should not be a sea-going cowboy, but there are several areas where you can improve your essay for clarity, organization, and correctness.

1. **Structure and Organization**: Your essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. Start with an introductory paragraph that outlines your main argument, and then conclude with a summary of your points. This will help the reader understand your perspective better.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some of your sentences are difficult to understand. For example, ""if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean."" This sentence could be clearer if you break it into shorter sentences and ensure proper use of verb tenses. 

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings throughout the essay, such as ""acording"" (according), ""paragrah4"" (paragraph 4), and ""sinked"" (sunk). Proofreading your work for spelling and grammatical errors will improve your writing significantly.

4. **Evidence and Examples**: While you provide examples to support your points, they need more context. For instance, when you mention Luke cracking his ribs, it would help to explain how this incident relates to your argument against him being a sea-going cowboy. More detailed explanations of your examples will strengthen your argument.

5. **Repetition and Focus**: You repeat some ideas, such as the risks of getting hurt or seasick. Try to consolidate these points and focus on developing each argument more thoroughly rather than repeating similar ideas.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Revise your essay to include a clear introduction and conclusion.
- Focus on clarity by breaking down complex sentences and ensuring they are grammatically correct.
- Provide more context and detail for your examples to strengthen your argument.
- Proofread your work to catch spelling and grammatical mistakes before submission.

With these revisions, your essay can become more effective and engaging. Keep writing and revising; you're making progress!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents an interesting perspective on Luke's experience in the Seagoing Cowboys program, but it lacks clarity, organization, and proper grammar. The central idea is somewhat present, but the lack of structure makes it difficult to follow the argument being made. 

**Feedback:**

1. **Structure and Organization:** The essay appears to be a stream of consciousness rather than a structured argument. Consider breaking it into paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point. For instance, you could have an introduction, a body paragraph discussing Luke's experiences, and a conclusion reflecting on his future.

2. **Clarity and Focus:** While you convey enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowboys program, the ideas are not clearly articulated. Try to focus on one main idea per sentence and expand on it. This will help your reader understand your points better.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation:** There are multiple grammatical errors, such as incorrect contractions (e.g., ""like's"" should be ""likes"") and misplaced apostrophes in plural forms (e.g., ""job's"" should be ""jobs""). Additionally, run-on sentences make it challenging to read. Consider reviewing basic grammar rules and sentence structure to improve clarity.

4. **Spelling:** There are a few spelling errors (e.g., ""craked"" should be ""cracked,"" ""unitl"" should be ""until,"" ""progarm"" should be ""program""). Proofreading your work or using spell-check tools can help catch these mistakes.

5. **Engagement with the Topic:** Your enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowboys program comes through, which is great! However, try to provide more details about why you think it is beneficial for Luke. What specific experiences might he gain, and how does that connect to the themes of adventure or responsibility?

Overall, focusing on these areas will help improve your writing. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you're unsure about grammar or structure!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents an interesting concept about pursuing a job that one enjoys, specifically in a cowboy or seafaring context. However, the writing suffers from numerous spelling and grammatical errors, as well as issues with clarity and coherence. The ideas are repetitive, and the structure is chaotic, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main argument.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - The essay contains many run-on sentences that make it hard to understand your thoughts. Try breaking your ideas into shorter, clearer sentences. Each sentence should convey a single idea or thought.
   - Consider organizing your essay into distinct paragraphs. Each paragraph should focus on a specific point or aspect of your argument.

2. **Spelling and Grammar:**
   - There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""sould,"" ""becuse,"" ""acrossed,"" ""hores,"" ""boaut,"" ""tere,"" ""advecer,"" ""turnd,"" ""whet,"" ""thout,"" ""anther"") that distract from your message. It would be beneficial to proofread your work or use a spell-check tool before submission.
   - Pay attention to punctuation and capitalization rules. For instance, sentences should start with capital letters, and commas should be used to separate ideas appropriately.

3. **Repetition:**
   - You repeat certain phrases and ideas throughout the essay (e.g., the enjoyment of the job and the ability to travel). While it's good to emphasize your main points, try to vary your language and provide new insights with each mention.

4. **Structure:**
   - Introduce your main idea at the beginning of the essay clearly. For instance, state explicitly why you believe people should pursue this job.
   - Use supporting details to back up your claims. You mention that ""he likes that job a lot,"" but it would strengthen your argument to include specific examples of what makes the job enjoyable or rewarding.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - End with a strong conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your argument. This could also include a call to action, encouraging readers to consider pursuing a job they are passionate about.

In summary, while the essay has a promising theme, it needs significant improvements in clarity, structure, and mechanics. Focus on organizing your thoughts, proofreading for errors, and providing specific details to enhance your writing. Keep practicing, as writing is a skill that improves with time and effort!"
M5,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy.

What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents a personal narrative about Luke Bomberger and his experiences as a seagoing cowboy. While the essay touches on interesting elements of Luke's life, such as his motivations for joining, his adventures, and the challenges he faced, it lacks clarity, coherence, and proper structure. Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. **Organization and Structure**: The essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. A strong essay should start with a thesis statement that outlines the main points, followed by paragraphs that elaborate on each point, and a conclusion that summarizes the main ideas.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some sentences are fragmented or poorly constructed, making it difficult to follow the narrative. For example, ""He was working two part time jobs at the grocrey store and the bank and."" This sentence is incomplete and confusing. It's important to ensure that each sentence flows logically to the next.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several spelling errors and grammatical mistakes throughout the essay (e.g., ""grocrey"" should be ""grocery,"" ""freind"" should be ""friend,"" ""cought"" should be ""caught""). Proofreading for spelling and grammatical accuracy is essential for clarity.

4. **Details and Development**: While the essay mentions some activities and experiences, many ideas are underdeveloped. For instance, discussing the significance of the games played aboard or elaborating on the dangers of the sea could enhance the narrative. Providing more context and detail would help engage the reader.

5. **Characterization and Theme**: The ending statement about Luke being a hero is interesting but feels abrupt and unsupported by the preceding text. Expanding on what makes him a hero and how his experiences shaped him would strengthen the essay's overall theme.

**Feedback:**

1. **Revise for Structure**: Consider organizing your essay with a clear introduction that introduces Luke and his motivations, followed by paragraphs that describe his experiences, and a conclusion that reflects on what he learned or how he grew.

2. **Proofread Carefully**: Take time to check for spelling and grammatical errors. Reading your essay aloud can help identify awkward phrasing or incomplete thoughts.

3. **Expand on Ideas**: Provide more detail about Luke's experiences and feelings. Explain why becoming a seagoing cowboy was significant for him and how it impacted his life.

4. **Connect to a Larger Theme**: Think about what message you want to convey about Luke's experiences. Why is he a hero? How did his journey influence him and others around him? Expanding on these ideas will give your essay more depth.

By focusing on these areas, you can create a more polished and engaging essay that effectively communicates Luke Bomberger's story. Keep writing and revising!"
M7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ]""

**Evaluation:**
This essay presents a clear argument in favor of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, based on the experiences of Luke. The writer attempts to summarize Luke's experiences and the impact of the program on his life, which is a good foundation for an essay. However, the execution has several issues that need to be addressed for improvement.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear structure. It would benefit from an introductory paragraph that outlines the main argument and what the reader can expect. Each paragraph should ideally focus on a single point or theme.
   - The transitions between ideas are abrupt. Consider using transition words or phrases to guide the reader through your points more smoothly.

2. **Content and Detail:**
   - While you mention some experiences Luke had, such as visiting cities and activities on the ship, the explanations are quite vague. Provide more detail about why these experiences were significant or how they contributed to personal growth.
   - You refer to specific sections, but it would be clearer to summarize these points in your own words instead of citing sections. This will show your understanding of the material.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""passege"" should be ""passage,"" ""exsperences"" should be ""experiences,"" ""abourd"" should be ""aboard,"" ""agree"" should be ""agree,"" ""decendents"" should be ""descendants,"" and ""countrys"" should be ""countries""). Be sure to proofread your work to catch these errors.
   - Some sentences are awkwardly phrased or grammatically incorrect (e.g., ""he had to get water for the horses and feed them"" could be rephrased for clarity).

4. **Argument Development:**
   - The conclusion is a bit weak and could be strengthened. You briefly state that you agree with Luke, but it would be more compelling if you elaborated on why you believe the program is beneficial, perhaps by including personal reflections or broader implications of such experiences.

5. **Engagement:**
   - To enhance reader engagement, consider adding a personal touch or your own thoughts about the program and its impact. This will make your essay more relatable and interesting.

Overall, your essay has potential, but it requires more organization, detail, and attention to language mechanics. Take the time to revise and strengthen your arguments, and be sure to proofread your work before submission. Keep writing and practicing, and your skills will continue to improve!"
M8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.","

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an interesting perspective on how the story could change if told in the first person. The student demonstrates an understanding of the character Luke and highlights various aspects of his thoughts and feelings that could be explored in a first-person narrative. However, the essay has several areas that need improvement, both in content and in writing mechanics.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Structure**: 
   - The essay could benefit from clearer organization. It reads more like a stream of consciousness rather than a structured argument. Consider breaking it into paragraphs, each with a clear main idea. For example, one paragraph could focus on Luke's feelings about helping others, while another could explore his experiences in Europe.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**: 
   - There are numerous grammatical errors and typos (""saide"" should be ""said,"" ""geting"" should be ""getting,"" ""we would of know"" should be ""we would have known,"" etc.). Proofreading your work for spelling and grammatical accuracy will enhance the overall quality of your writing.

3. **Repetitiveness**: 
   - The phrase ""we would of know"" is repeated several times. Try to find synonyms or rephrase your thoughts to avoid redundancy. This will make your writing more engaging.

4. **Support Your Ideas**: 
   - While you mention various aspects of Luke's potential thoughts and feelings, providing specific examples or quotes from the text would strengthen your argument. This will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the story and provide evidence for your claims.

5. **Avoid Confrontational Language**: 
   - Phrases like ""And don't say that I'm wrong because it is true"" can come across as defensive. Instead, focus on presenting your ideas confidently and respectfully. This creates a more persuasive and professional tone.

6. **Expand on Ideas**: 
   - While you touch on several interesting points, you could elaborate on them. For example, discussing more about Luke's relationship with his friends or the significance of the experiences he had could enrich your essay.

7. **Conclusion**: 
   - The essay lacks a clear conclusion that summarizes your main points. A concluding paragraph can help reinforce your argument and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Overall, you have a good foundation for your essay, and with some revisions and attention to detail, you can develop a more polished and compelling piece. Keep practicing your writing skills, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need clarification on grammar or structure!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay attempts to narrate the experiences of Luke Bomberger during World War II; however, it is marred by numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and structural issues that hinder readability and clarity. The narrative jumps around in time and theme, making it difficult for the reader to follow the story. Additionally, the essay lacks coherence and organization, which are crucial for effective storytelling.

**Feedback:**

1. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are multiple spelling errors (e.g., ""remeber,"" ""affcted,"" ""august,"" ""coulped"") that need correction. It’s essential to proofread your work before submission.
   - Sentence structure is often awkward or incorrect. For instance, ""he can't harley remeber 1"" could be rephrased for clarity.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - The essay jumps between ideas without clear transitions. Try to organize your thoughts logically. Each paragraph should represent a single idea or theme.
   - For example, the transition from Luke's journey to his training is abrupt. Consider using transitional phrases to guide the reader.

3. **Content Development:**
   - While the essay contains interesting ideas about Luke’s experiences, they are not fully developed. Provide more details and context to enhance the narrative.
   - Expand on key events, emotions, and the impact of these experiences on Luke and his family.

4. **Structure:**
   - The essay lacks proper paragraphs. Break your writing into clear sections to improve readability. Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that introduces its main idea.
   - Consider starting with an introduction that sets the stage for Luke's story, followed by body paragraphs that explore specific events, and a conclusion that reflects on his experiences.

5. **Punctuation and Sentence Structure:**
   - Many sentences are run-ons or fragments. Use punctuation correctly to separate ideas and clarify meaning. For instance, ""He said it took about two weeks about trying to get to atlantic oncan and prafict oncan"" could be revised for clarity and conciseness.

6. **Engagement:**
   - To make your writing more engaging, consider adding sensory details and emotions. How did Luke feel during his journey? What challenges did he face? This will help readers connect with the character.

**Overall Suggestion:**
Take the time to revise your essay, focusing on clarity, grammar, and structure. Consider outlining your ideas before writing to create a more organized narrative. With revision and attention to detail, your essay can become a compelling story of Luke’s experiences."

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay about ""A Cowboy Who Rode Waves."" You did a great job of capturing the main events and emotions of the story, particularly how Luke’s feelings evolved from initial enjoyment to a deep love for the experience. Here are some specific points of feedback that can help you improve your writing:

1. **Structure and Organization**: The essay lacks clear organization. It would benefit from a clearer introduction, body, and conclusion. Starting with an introduction to the story and its main character would set the stage for your readers. Each paragraph should ideally focus on a single idea or event.

2. **Clarity and Detail**: While you provided a summary of the events, some details could be expanded upon to enhance clarity. For instance, you mention that Luke enjoyed seeing animals, but elaborating on what types of animals he saw or how they made him feel would create a more vivid picture for the reader.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings, such as ""urope,"" ""definetally,"" ""freind,"" ""nother,"" and ""excpiorience."" Proofreading your work or using spell-check tools can help catch these mistakes. Additionally, proper capitalization and punctuation (like starting sentences with capital letters and using periods effectively) will improve readability.

4. **Character Development and Opinions**: You mention that some people didn’t enjoy the trip, but you could explore this aspect more. Why do you think they felt that way? Including different perspectives can add depth to your essay. Also, integrating more of Luke’s thoughts and feelings would help readers connect with him on a personal level.

5. **Conclusion**: The essay ends abruptly without a proper conclusion. Summarizing Luke's journey and expressing what he learned or how he changed would provide a more satisfying ending.

Overall, you have a solid foundation with interesting ideas, but focusing on structure, clarity, and mechanics will significantly enhance your writing. Keep practicing, and I look forward to seeing your improvements in future essays!"

**Evaluation:**
This essay presents a narrative about the experiences of someone involved in seagoing, discussing the benefits and challenges of this lifestyle. However, the writing lacks organization, clarity, and contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors that affect its overall readability. 

**Feedback:**

1. **Content Understanding:** 
   - You provide some interesting points about the life of a seagoing individual, including the adventures and hard work involved. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure. Consider organizing your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of seagoing (e.g., the benefits, challenges, personal experiences).

2. **Clarity and Cohesion:** 
   - Some sentences are unclear or run-on, making it difficult for the reader to follow your ideas. For example, the sentence ""He tells you that his friend tolled him that he should work there, so he could not say no..."" could be simplified for clarity. Aim to use shorter, more direct sentences to convey your points.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:** 
   - There are several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes throughout the essay that detract from its professionalism. Here are a few corrections:
     - ""becouse"" should be ""because""
     - ""he's ribs"" should be ""his ribs""
     - ""told"" instead of ""tolled""
     - ""board"" instead of ""borad""
     - ""took"" instead of ""toke""
     - ""month"" instead of ""mouth""
     - ""check"" instead of ""cheak""
     - ""2ed"" should be ""2nd""
     - ""watchman"" instead of ""wachman""
   - Proofreading your work can help catch these mistakes before submission.

4. **Engagement and Style:** 
   - While you are conveying an exciting topic, the essay could be more engaging with the use of descriptive language and varied sentence structures. Try to incorporate more vivid details about the experiences being described to draw the reader in.

5. **Conclusion:** 
   - The essay lacks a clear conclusion. Summarizing the key points and reiterating the importance of seagoing would provide a strong ending and help reinforce your argument.

**Overall Suggestions:**
- Revise your essay by organizing it into clear paragraphs, correcting grammatical errors, and enhancing your descriptive language. This will help convey your message more effectively and make your writing more enjoyable to read. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek help with editing!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for your submission. Your essay provides a basic overview of the author's arguments about Venus, touching on both the positive and negative aspects. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

**Strengths:**

1. **Content Understanding:** You demonstrate an understanding of the author's ideas regarding Venus, mentioning both its appeal and the associated dangers. This shows you engaged with the material.
2. **Structure:** You mention that the author organized their essay well and that they effectively restated the question at the end. This is an important aspect of essay writing.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Coherence:** Your writing would benefit from clearer expression of ideas. Some sentences are vague or repetitive, which makes it difficult to follow your argument. For example, phrases like ""he explained both bad and good thing about venus"" could be rephrased for clarity to ""he discussed both the advantages and disadvantages of Venus.""

2. **Grammar and Mechanics:** There are several grammatical errors and typos throughout your essay. For instance, ""explaning"" should be ""explaining,"" ""didnt"" should be ""didn't,"" and ""puting"" should be ""putting."" Pay attention to punctuation and proper sentence structure to enhance readability.

3. **Depth of Analysis:** While you touched on both sides of the argument, your analysis could be deeper. For instance, providing specific examples or quotes from the text would strengthen your points. Instead of saying he ""knew everything about it all,"" consider summarizing specific insights he presented.

4. **Conclusion:** Your final thoughts feel somewhat abrupt. A more developed conclusion that synthesizes your main points would make your essay stronger. Try to summarize your main observations and why they matter in the context of the essay you analyzed.

5. **Use of Evidence:** To support your claims, incorporate more direct references or quotations from the text. This will give your evaluation more authority and make it easier for readers to understand the points you are discussing.

**Overall Suggestions:**
- Review your grammar and spelling.
- Focus on creating clear, concise sentences.
- Provide specific examples from the text to back up your claims.
- Develop your conclusion to wrap up your thoughts more effectively.

By addressing these areas, you can create a more compelling and polished piece of writing. Keep practicing, and you will see improvement in your essay writing skills!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents a clear topic centered around the experiences of Luke Bomberger as a Seagoing Cowboy and the impact of that program on his life and the community. However, it lacks depth, organization, and clarity in several areas. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Theme:** The essay focuses on the positive aspects of helping others through the Seagoing Cowboys program.
2. **Personal Connection:** The mention of Luke's gratitude and personal experience adds a relatable touch to the essay.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Organization and Structure:** The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider using an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion to better organize your thoughts. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea that supports your main argument.
  
2. **Clarity and Grammar:** There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases (e.g., ""a alot of people,"" ""convensing,"" ""greatfull,"" ""sucha s sports and otheres""). Proofreading for spelling, punctuation, and grammar will significantly improve the clarity of your writing.

3. **Depth of Content:** The essay touches on the benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy but does not explore these ideas in depth. Providing specific examples or anecdotes about Luke's experiences could enhance the essay. Additionally, discussing the broader impact on the community or how others might be inspired could add richness to your argument.

4. **Transitions:** The flow between ideas can be improved with better transition phrases that guide the reader through your thoughts. This will help in maintaining coherence throughout the essay.

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. Summarizing the main points or offering a final thought on the importance of community service could create a stronger ending.

**Overall Feedback:**
While the essay contains a positive message and a good starting point, it needs significant revisions for clarity, organization, and depth. Take the time to outline your ideas, proofread for errors, and expand on your thoughts to create a more compelling and polished piece. Keep working on your writing, and don't hesitate to ask for feedback as you revise!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents a clear stance on whether Luke should go on a trip to China with his friend. The writer offers some reasons to support their opinion, but the development of these ideas lacks depth and clarity. There are several strengths and areas for improvement to consider.

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Position:** The essay clearly states that Luke should go on the trip, which provides a focus for the argument.
2. **Basic Structure:** The essay follows a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, making it easier for readers to follow the writer's thoughts.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Focus:** The introduction is somewhat confusing. The phrase, ""Keep reading to find out find out some reasons why he should go to the trip with his friend,"" is repetitive and could be more concise. Aim for clarity in your opening statements.
   
2. **Development of Ideas:** While you mention reasons for both going and not going, the arguments for why Luke should go are not fully developed. Consider expanding on how exploring new places can benefit Luke personally and intellectually. Providing specific examples or scenarios could strengthen your argument.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation:** There are several grammatical issues, such as run-on sentences and punctuation errors. For example, “did't” should be “didn’t,” “existed” should replace “exested,” and there are missing spaces after commas. Careful proofreading can help catch these mistakes.

4. **Depth of Argument:** The reasons against going on the trip (ship crashing, running out of food, getting stranded) are quite dramatic and may detract from your overall argument. Instead, consider more realistic concerns or counterpoints that would present a fairer view of both sides.

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion could be stronger. It currently reiterates points without adding any new insights. Try to summarize your main arguments and reinforce why the positive aspects outweigh the negatives.

**Feedback:**

To improve your essay, focus on developing your ideas more thoroughly. Provide specific examples and elaborate on your points to make your argument more persuasive. Make sure to proofread your work for grammatical errors and clarity. A well-structured argument with clear reasoning will engage your reader more effectively. Keep practicing, and your writing will continue to improve!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay attempts to narrate the experience of a character (presumably Luke) who joins a cattle boat after working part-time jobs. While there are some interesting elements in the story, the essay suffers from numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of clarity in structure, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Engagement with Topic:** The essay presents a unique perspective on post-World War II relief efforts, which is an interesting angle. The connection between personal experience and historical context is commendable.
2. **Descriptive Elements:** There are moments where the writer attempts to describe events, such as Luke climbing the ladder and the experience of unloading animals. This adds some vivid imagery to the narrative.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are numerous spelling errors (e.g., ""freind,"" ""devistated,"" ""loses,"" ""Augast"") that significantly affect readability. Additionally, grammatical issues, such as run-on sentences and incorrect verb tenses, need to be addressed.
  
2. **Organization and Structure:** The essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps from one idea to another without smooth transitions, making it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative. Consider organizing the essay into clear paragraphs with distinct main ideas.

3. **Clarity and Coherence:** Some sentences are confusing or incomplete, such as ""the. Contries were caled the (United Nations Relief and Rehabitation Administration)."" This could be clarified and rephrased for better understanding.

4. **Detail and Development:** While the essay mentions various activities on the boat, it lacks depth in exploring Luke's feelings and experiences. Expanding on these moments would provide a stronger emotional connection for the reader.

5. **Punctuation and Capitalization:** The use of punctuation is inconsistent, and some sentences are missing necessary punctuation marks. Proper capitalization should also be maintained throughout (e.g., ""United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration"").

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, I recommend focusing on clarity, organization, and grammar. Start by outlining your main points before writing to ensure a logical flow. Pay attention to spelling and grammar, as these are essential for making your writing clear and professional. Additionally, try to elaborate on your character's emotions and experiences to create a more engaging narrative. Consider seeking assistance from a peer or teacher for proofreading to help catch any errors before submission. Keep writing, and with practice, you can greatly improve your skills!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents a clear enthusiasm for the subject of Seagoing Cowgirls and the character Luke's aspirations. However, the writing lacks structure, coherence, and clarity. While the central idea—that Luke should join the program to pursue her interests—is present, it is not effectively communicated due to several issues:

1. **Grammar and Spelling:** The essay contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""actullay,"" ""dissions,"" ""hie,"" ""clollege"") that detract from the overall readability and professionalism of the writing. Proper proofreading would significantly improve the quality.

2. **Repetition and Redundancy:** The essay often repeats phrases and ideas (e.g., ""might help me with something,"" ""Luke is a good person""), which makes it feel redundant. It would benefit from more varied language and a more concise expression of thoughts.

3. **Structure and Organization:** The essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or point that supports the thesis. A more organized approach would help the reader follow the argument more easily.

4. **Clarity and Coherence:** Some sentences are difficult to understand or seem disjointed (e.g., ""Luke it all like well i kind a mightlike this program""). Sentences should be complete and clearly convey the intended message.

5. **Depth of Analysis:** While it is clear that the student admires Luke and wants to support her decision, the essay lacks deeper analysis or specific examples that would strengthen the argument for why Luke should join the program.

**Feedback:**

1. **Proofread Your Work:** Always take the time to revise your essay for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. This will make your writing much clearer and easier to read.

2. **Organize Your Ideas:** Consider using a structured format with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea that supports your main argument.

3. **Avoid Repetition:** Try to express your ideas in different ways to keep the reader engaged. Instead of repeating the same thoughts, expand on them with examples or explanations.

4. **Develop Your Argument:** Provide specific examples or details that illustrate why Luke should join the program. This could include her interests, potential benefits, or personal growth opportunities.

5. **Clarify Your Sentences:** Make sure your sentences are complete and convey your thoughts clearly. If a sentence feels confusing, try rewriting it for clarity.

Overall, with some revisions and a more structured approach, your essay can effectively convey your support for Luke's journey and aspirations. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay. You've chosen an interesting topic, and I appreciate your effort in expressing your thoughts. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing. Here’s some specific feedback:

1. **Thesis Statement and Structure**: You have a thesis that suggests why Luke should not be a sea-going cowgirl, but it’s not clearly articulated at the beginning of your essay. Consider starting with a clear thesis statement that sets the stage for your argument. Additionally, ensure that your paragraphs follow a logical structure, beginning with a clear topic sentence.

2. **Paragraphing and Organization**: The essay lacks clear paragraph breaks, which makes it difficult to follow your argument. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea and be clearly defined. For example, separate the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion to guide the reader through your argument.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that detract from the professionalism of your writing. For instance, ""acording"" should be ""according,"" and ""did'nt"" should be ""didn't."" Proofreading your work or using spell-check tools can help catch these mistakes.

4. **Details and Clarity**: While you include some specific examples, they are somewhat confusing and need clarification. For instance, the connection between falling and cracking ribs and the potential danger of sharks is a bit unclear. Make sure to clearly explain how each example supports your argument.

5. **Transitions and Flow**: Your writing would benefit from better transitions between ideas and sentences. This will help create a smoother reading experience. For example, using phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" or ""On the other hand"" can help connect your thoughts more effectively.

6. **Conclusion**: The essay lacks a conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces the thesis. A strong conclusion is essential to leaving a lasting impression on the reader.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Revisit your thesis and ensure it's clear and strong.
- Organize your ideas into well-defined paragraphs.
- Proofread for grammar and spelling errors.
- Clarify your examples and ensure they directly support your argument.
- Add transitions for better flow and coherence.
- Include a strong concluding paragraph.

Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Writing is a process, and with dedication, you can improve significantly!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents a personal viewpoint on the character Luke and her involvement in the Seagoing Cowgirls program. The writer expresses enthusiasm for the program and shares some insights into Luke’s experiences, but the essay lacks clarity, organization, and grammatical correctness. Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Organization**: The essay is difficult to follow due to a lack of clear structure. Ideas are presented in a somewhat scattered manner, making it hard for the reader to understand the main points. Consider organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs, each focusing on a specific idea (e.g., Luke’s experiences in the program, the impact of her injury, her aspirations).

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are numerous grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues (e.g., ""she like's"" should be ""she likes"") and misplaced apostrophes (e.g., ""job's"" should be ""jobs""). Additionally, some sentences are run-on and lack proper punctuation. Revising these elements will significantly improve the readability of your essay.

3. **Spelling**: There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""craked"" should be ""cracked,"" ""tink"" should be ""think,"" ""progarm"" should be ""program""). Proofreading your work or using spelling and grammar tools can help catch these errors.

4. **Supporting Details**: While you express a clear opinion about Luke and the program, more specific examples or details would strengthen your argument. For instance, you could elaborate on what types of animals Luke cares for or describe a specific experience she had in the program.

5. **Conclusion**: The essay lacks a concluding statement that summarizes your thoughts or reinforces your opinion. A strong conclusion can help tie together your main points and leave the reader with a lasting impression.

**Feedback for Improvement**:

- Take time to outline your essay before writing to ensure a logical flow of ideas.
- Focus on writing complete sentences and using correct grammar and punctuation.
- Include more specific examples to illustrate your points and make your essay more engaging.
- After writing, always proofread your work to catch any errors.

By addressing these areas, your writing can become clearer and more impactful. Keep practicing, and consider using writing resources or support for further improvement!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an interesting idea about a job that involves traveling across the ocean and riding horses. However, it struggles with clarity, organization, and grammar, which makes it difficult to fully understand the main points. Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Focus:** The essay lacks a clear thesis statement or main idea. While it seems to advocate for a specific job, the reasoning is repetitive and not well-developed. It would be beneficial to clearly state what the job is and why it is appealing.

2. **Organization:** The essay jumps between ideas without clear transitions. Structuring the essay into distinct paragraphs would help improve its flow. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea related to the main thesis.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are numerous spelling mistakes (e.g., ""sould"" instead of ""should,"" ""acrossed"" instead of ""across,"" ""hores"" instead of ""horses"") and grammatical errors that make the writing difficult to read. Proofreading for spelling and grammatical accuracy is essential.

4. **Detail and Development:** The essay could benefit from more specific examples and details. For instance, explaining what makes the job enjoyable or discussing experiences related to it would strengthen the argument.

5. **Conclusion:** The essay ends abruptly without a strong concluding statement. A conclusion should summarize the main points and reinforce why others should consider this job.

**Feedback:**

To improve your essay, I suggest the following steps:

M-F5,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl. She is trying to tell girls that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowgirl. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowgirl. What she is saying is that she is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story she states that she went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. She says that she could go to China, and Europe on her extra time, and that she enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that she helped around the house as a young girl, and that helped her grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. She also states that she was a night watchmen, and she checked the animals every hour.

She also says that one night she was sliding downa latter on her back side and almost fell off the ship. All though she couldn't work for a few days, she satses that she was very thankful to be alive.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowgirl would be a good idea for young girls for somthing to do for a while.","

**Evaluation:**
The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the passage and attempts to summarize the key points regarding the experiences of a ""seagoing cowgirl."" However, the writing is hindered by several issues, including grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and a lack of coherent organization. While the essay presents relevant ideas, the execution could be significantly improved.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Focus:** 
   - The main idea of the essay is somewhat clear, but it could benefit from a stronger thesis statement that outlines what the essay will discuss. Consider starting with a clear introductory sentence that captures the essence of the passage.

2. **Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps from one idea to another without smooth transitions. Organizing your thoughts into paragraphs can help improve the flow. For example, you could have one paragraph focusing on the opportunities of being a seagoing cowgirl, another on the challenges faced, and a final paragraph on the overall impact of these experiences.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the readability of your essay. For example, ""fro"" should be ""for,"" ""havig"" should be ""having,"" and ""greece"" should be capitalized as ""Greece."" Proofreading your work before submission can help catch these mistakes.

4. **Detail and Development:**
   - While you mention various experiences, some points are not fully developed. For instance, you mention the night watchman experience but do not explain why that was significant or what it taught her. Expanding on these experiences would provide more depth to your essay.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion could be stronger. Instead of simply stating that being a seagoing cowgirl would be a good idea, you could summarize the benefits discussed in the essay and reinforce why this role is valuable for young girls.

6. **Engagement and Voice:**
   - Try to engage the reader by expressing your own thoughts or feelings about the topic. Including personal reflections can make your writing more compelling.

**Overall Recommendation:**
To improve your writing, focus on organizing your thoughts clearly, checking for grammatical errors, and expanding your ideas with more detail. With careful revision and attention to these areas, your writing can become more effective and engaging. Keep practicing!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay attempts to convey the experiences of Luke Bomberger as a seagoing cowgirl, highlighting both the opportunities she faced and the challenges she encountered. However, there are several areas that require improvement, including clarity, organization, grammar, and punctuation.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Focus:**
   - The essay has a central idea about Luke's journey and experiences, but it lacks clarity. The introduction is confusing and does not clearly state the purpose of the essay. Consider starting with a strong thesis statement that outlines what you will discuss.

2. **Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear structure. Each paragraph should address a specific aspect of Luke's experience. For example, one paragraph could focus on her reasons for joining, another on her experiences aboard, and a third on her challenges. This will help the reader follow your narrative more easily.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation:**
   - There are numerous grammatical errors and punctuation issues that hinder the readability of the essay. For example, ""grocrey"" should be spelled ""grocery,"" and ""opend"" should be ""opened."" Ensure that sentences are complete and avoid run-on sentences. For instance, ""It was a opportunity of a life time so she had to take it her life was just begning"" could be revised to: ""It was an opportunity of a lifetime, so she had to take it. Her life was just beginning.""

4. **Details and Development:**
   - While you mention fun activities and challenges, the details provided are often vague or incomplete. Expand on these experiences to provide more depth. For instance, describe what it was like for Luke to play games at sea or elaborate on the dangers she faced as a night watchman.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion is too abrupt and does not effectively summarize the essay or reinforce the main ideas. Consider restating why Luke's experiences as a seagoing cowgirl are significant and what they reveal about her character.

**Overall,** with revisions for clarity, organization, grammar, and depth, this essay has the potential to effectively showcase Luke Bomberger's journey as a seagoing cowgirl. Take the time to revise your work, and consider seeking feedback from peers or utilizing writing resources to strengthen your writing skills."
M-F7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. If you read the passege, Luke says her life was changed and she had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities she visted. Some of things she visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things she did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things she did on board. She had to get water for the horses and feed them. She also had to be a nightwatch women.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowgirls is not a bad idea. She says that it changed her life and she got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because she did the program her decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents a clear intention to persuade the reader to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program by referencing the experiences of ""Luke."" However, several areas need improvement, including organization, clarity, grammar, and spelling.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Thesis:** The essay starts with a clear statement about the benefits of joining the Seagoing Cowgirls program.
2. **Referenced Experiences:** The mention of specific locations and activities provides some insight into what participants might experience, which adds to the persuasive element.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Organization and Structure:** The essay lacks a coherent structure. Each paragraph should ideally focus on a single main idea. Consider using clear topic sentences and transitions between ideas to improve flow.
   
2. **Clarity and Detail:** While the essay mentions some activities and experiences, it could benefit from more detailed explanations. For example, briefly explaining how these experiences changed Luke's life would make the argument stronger.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are several spelling errors (e.g., ""passege,"" ""exsperences,"" ""abourd,"" ""aggre,"" ""decendents,"" ""countrys"") and grammatical mistakes (e.g., ""nightwatch women"" should be ""nightwatchwoman""). Proofreading for these issues would enhance the professionalism of the writing.

4. **Use of Evidence:** The essay references ""Sections 6, 7, and 8"" and ""Section 9,"" but it doesn't clearly explain what these sections contain. Including direct quotes or more information about these sections would strengthen the arguments.

5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. Reinforce the main points made in the essay and finish with a compelling closing statement that encourages the reader to consider joining the program.

**Feedback for Improvement:**
- Revise the essay for clarity and coherence. Use clear topic sentences and ensure each paragraph has a defined focus.
- Edit for spelling and grammatical errors; consider using tools or seeking help to proofread your writing.
- Add more specific details and examples to strengthen your arguments. Instead of just stating that things changed for Luke, explain how and why.
- Consider structuring your conclusion to summarize the main points and leave the reader with a strong reason to consider the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

With some revisions and attention to detail, this essay could be much more persuasive and engaging. Keep working on your writing skills!"
M-F8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what she thinks about what she is doing,what she thinks about her friends, and what she thinks of helping others. But I bet she would think nice things about helping people because she saide that she liked the job. And when her friend asked her if she wanted to go with her she said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it she didnt want to miss. She also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and she also liked the journey geting to Europe with her friend. Plus we would of know what she thought about the journey,the place she was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what she thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what she thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how she felt when she craked her ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that she had with her new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what she felt and thought of it. Did she like it or not. And how about her family we would of know what she thought of them. Of course she would say good things about them but still we would of know more about her thoughts and feelings.

**Evaluation:**

This essay attempts to explore how the narrative perspective of a story impacts our understanding of a character’s thoughts and feelings. The student identifies key elements of what might be revealed if the story were told in the first person, such as the protagonist's opinions on helping others, her experiences, and her family. However, the essay lacks structure, clarity, and grammatical accuracy, which significantly detracts from its overall effectiveness.

**Strengths:**
1. **Understanding of Perspective:** The student demonstrates an understanding of how narrative perspective can shape a reader's experience of a story.
2. **Engagement with Content:** The essay engages with specific examples from the text, showing an effort to connect the discussion to the character's journey.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Structure:** The essay would benefit from a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Organizing thoughts into coherent paragraphs with topic sentences would improve readability.
2. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it challenging to follow the student's argument. Breaking these down into shorter, clearer sentences would enhance understanding.
3. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are multiple grammatical errors (e.g., ""saide"" should be ""said,"" ""geting"" should be ""getting,"" ""would of"" should be ""would have""). Proofreading for spelling and grammatical accuracy is essential.
4. **Repetition:** The phrase ""we would of know"" is repeated several times. Varying language and reducing redundancy would strengthen the writing.
5. **Evidence and Analysis:** While the student provides some examples, they could delve deeper into the implications of the first-person perspective rather than just listing what could have been included.

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, start by organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs. Begin with an introduction that outlines your main argument. Each paragraph should focus on a specific point, using clear topic sentences. Be mindful of grammar and spelling; consider using tools or seeking help to proofread your writing. Additionally, try to analyze the significance of the first-person perspective more thoroughly rather than just listing potential insights. This will not only enhance your argument but also demonstrate a deeper understanding of narrative techniques. Keep practicing, and your writing will continue to improve!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay! You have chosen an interesting topic about a young woman named Luke Bomberger who experiences significant events during World War II. Your writing demonstrates creativity and an effort to convey a narrative, but there are several areas that need improvement.

**Strengths:**
1. **Unique Perspective:** Writing from the perspective of a cowgirl who becomes involved in World War II is a unique angle that could engage readers. This choice adds depth to the character of Luke.
2. **Imaginative Elements:** You include various details about Luke’s experiences, such as her travels and challenges, which help to paint a picture of her journey.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Organization:** The essay lacks clear structure, making it difficult to follow. Consider organizing your thoughts into distinct paragraphs that focus on specific events or themes. This will help readers understand the progression of Luke’s story.
   
2. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay (e.g., ""harley,"" ""affcted,"" ""discharded,"" ""oncan,"" ""prafict,"" ""coulped""). Proofreading your work for spelling and grammar would enhance its readability. Using spell check tools can also be helpful.

3. **Sentence Structure:** Many sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation, which makes them challenging to read. Aim for clearer, more concise sentences. For example, instead of ""she said to herself that she was grateful,"" you could say, ""She felt grateful for the food and supplies she found.""

4. **Detail and Development:** While you provide some interesting details, some parts of the story feel rushed or underdeveloped. For instance, you mention Luke's training and experiences but do not elaborate on how these experiences affect her emotionally. Adding depth to her feelings and thoughts could create a stronger connection with the reader.

5. **Historical Accuracy:** If your essay is intended to reflect historical events, ensure that the details align with factual information about World War II. Researching historical context can enhance the authenticity of the narrative.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Revise your essay by breaking it into paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of Luke's journey.
- Review your work for spelling and grammar errors, and consider using tools or asking for help to improve these areas.
- Add more emotional depth by exploring Luke's feelings and reactions throughout her experiences.
- Ensure historical accuracy by researching the events and experiences of individuals during World War II.

Overall, you have a good foundation for your essay, and with some revisions and attention to detail, it can become a more engaging and polished piece of writing. Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing your revisions!"

1. **Narrative Structure:** The essay follows a basic narrative arc, describing Luke's initial feelings, her challenges, and her eventual success.
2. **Personal Connection:** The use of first-person perspective allows for a personal connection to Luke's experiences.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Organization:** The essay feels disjointed and lacks logical flow. Transitions between ideas are abrupt, making it difficult for the reader to follow Luke's journey. Organizing the essay into clear paragraphs would improve its readability.
   
2. **Grammar and Mechanics:** There are numerous grammatical errors and typos (e.g., ""definetally,"" ""europ,"" ""freind,"" ""nother,"" ""excpiorience"") that distract from the content. Proofreading for spelling, punctuation, and capitalization would greatly enhance the clarity of the writing.
   
3. **Detail and Development:** The essay could benefit from more descriptive language and details about Luke's feelings and experiences. For instance, instead of just stating that she ""fell off a couple times,"" providing more insight into her emotions during these moments could engage the reader further.

4. **Addressing Counterarguments:** The essay mentions that some people did not enjoy the trip but does not explore this point further. A brief discussion on differing perspectives could add depth to the narrative.

5. **Conclusion:** The ending feels abrupt. A more reflective conclusion summarizing Luke's experience and the lessons learned from it would provide a satisfying closure to the essay.

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, focus on organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs. Each paragraph should have a main idea that supports your overall narrative. Additionally, pay attention to grammar and spelling; using tools like spell check can help catch errors. Try to add more descriptive details that show the reader what Luke is feeling and experiencing, which can make your writing more engaging. Lastly, consider exploring different viewpoints to add depth to your writing. Keep practicing, and you will see improvement in your writing skills!"

**Evaluation:**
This essay attempts to convey the experiences and benefits of being a seagoing individual, but it struggles with clarity, coherence, and several grammatical issues. The main ideas are presented, but they often lack sufficient detail and organization. Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that distract from the message. The narrative could benefit from a clearer structure, with distinct sections for the introduction, body, and conclusion.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. Starting with a brief introduction about what ""seagoing"" means and why it's significant would help set the stage for your discussion.
   - Consider organizing your thoughts into paragraphs. Each paragraph should cover a specific idea or aspect of being a seagoing individual.

2. **Detail and Support:**
   - While you mention several experiences and activities, providing more specific details about each would strengthen your argument. For example, you could elaborate on the dangers of the sea and what it means to be a night watchman.
   - Including more personal anecdotes or reflections on your experiences would make your writing more engaging.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling errors (e.g., ""becouse,"" ""tolled,"" ""borad,"" ""toke,"" ""mouth,"" ""wachman,"" ""yous""). Proofreading your essay or using spell-check tools can help catch these mistakes.
   - Pay attention to sentence structure. Many sentences are run-on or fragmented, making it hard to follow your ideas. Breaking them into shorter, clearer sentences would improve readability.

4. **Transitions:**
   - Use transitional phrases to connect your ideas better. This will help guide the reader through your essay and improve the flow of your writing.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - A concluding paragraph summarizing the main points and restating the significance of being a seagoing individual would provide a strong finish to your essay. It’s an opportunity to leave a lasting impression on your readers.

Overall, while your essay has the foundation of an interesting narrative, focusing on organization, detail, and grammar will significantly enhance your writing. Keep practicing, and consider revising this essay with these suggestions in mind!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents a clear intent to discuss the positive aspects of being a Seagoing Cowgirl and how it fosters community and personal growth. The student effectively conveys the idea that helping others can lead to personal fulfillment and has a ripple effect within the community. However, the essay suffers from several structural and grammatical issues that detract from its overall clarity and coherence.

**Feedback:**

1. **Structure and Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. Consider starting with a brief introduction that outlines the main idea and ending with a summary or a final thought that reinforces your message.
   - The flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed. Try to use transition phrases to connect your thoughts more smoothly. For example, instead of jumping from one point to another, you might say, ""Additionally, Luke's experience has encouraged her family to spread the word about the program.""

2. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - Some sentences are unclear or awkwardly phrased, such as ""She is convensing people because she said that she was greatfull for such an amazing time."" It would be beneficial to rephrase this for clarity. For example, ""She is convincing others to join the program by sharing how grateful she is for her experience.""
   - Ensure that your main points are clearly articulated. For example, the phrase ""the awareness stayed with her"" is vague. Consider explaining what you mean by ""awareness.""

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling mistakes (e.g., ""alot"" should be ""a lot,"" ""convensing"" should be ""convincing,"" and ""greatfull"" should be ""grateful""). Proofreading your work for spelling and grammar errors can significantly improve the quality of your essay.
   - Pay attention to punctuation and capitalization, such as ""seagoing Cowgirls"" which should be consistently capitalized as ""Seagoing Cowgirls.""

4. **Content Development:**
   - While the essay touches on important themes, it could benefit from more specific examples or anecdotes. Including a personal story or a specific event from the Seagoing Cowgirls program would strengthen your argument and engage your readers more.
   - Consider elaborating more on the kinds of activities involved in the Seagoing Cowgirls program and how they contribute to both personal and community growth.

5. **Engagement:**
   - To make your essay more engaging, consider adding emotional appeal. How does helping others make Luke feel? What impact does it have on the people she helps?

**Conclusion:**
Overall, you have a solid foundation for your essay, but with some revisions in structure, clarity, and mechanics, it could be much stronger. Focus on organizing your ideas more clearly, proofreading for errors, and elaborating on your main points to make your argument more compelling. Keep up the effort!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an interesting premise about a character named Luke contemplating a trip to China. While the structure is present, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and coherence, as well as to engage the reader more effectively.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Position**: The essay clearly states the author's opinion that Luke should go on the trip, which provides a foundational argument for the piece.
2. **Basic Structure**: The essay attempts to follow a structured format with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is a good start.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Consistency**: The essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detracts from its clarity. For example, phrases like ""I think she should go"" and ""find out find out"" are confusing. Proofreading for repetition and grammatical accuracy would greatly enhance the essay.
   
2. **Character Consistency**: There is a confusing switch in pronouns, as Luke is referred to as ""she"" which may confuse readers if Luke is expected to be a male name. Consistency in referring to the character is crucial.

3. **Argument Development**: The reasons provided for why Luke should go on the trip are somewhat underdeveloped. Instead of merely listing potential benefits (exploration, relaxation), the essay could delve deeper into how these experiences would positively impact Luke's life. Providing specific examples or anecdotes would make the argument more persuasive.

4. **Counterarguments**: While the essay mentions some reasons against going on the trip, these points are not elaborated upon. Instead of simply listing fears (like a ship crash or running out of food), the author could discuss how these fears might be mitigated or addressed, which would create a more balanced argument.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion reiterates the main points but lacks a strong closing statement that reinforces the main argument. A more impactful conclusion could summarize the key points and leave the reader with a thought-provoking remark or call to action.

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, consider the following steps:
- Revise for grammar and coherence. Read your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing and errors.
- Be consistent with character names and pronouns to avoid confusion.
- Develop your arguments further; provide specific examples and elaborate on your points.
- Address counterarguments more thoroughly to strengthen your position.
- Craft a more engaging conclusion that encapsulates your main ideas and leaves a lasting impression.

Overall, you have a solid foundation. With some revisions and expansions, your essay can become much stronger and more persuasive. Keep writing!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for sharing your essay. You chose a compelling topic related to post-World War II humanitarian efforts, which is important and interesting. However, there are several areas where your essay can be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall quality.

1. **Structure and Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear structure. Consider organizing your writing into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific idea or event. This will help readers follow your narrative more easily.
   - Begin with an introduction that outlines the main idea of your essay. Follow with body paragraphs that explore different aspects of your topic, and conclude with a summary or reflection on what was learned.

2. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - Some sentences are confusing and could be rephrased for better understanding. For example, ""the reason she joined was because her friend offered she the job"" could be rewritten as ""She joined because her friend offered her the job.""
   - Maintain a consistent subject throughout the essay. You switch between referring to ""she"" and ""luke,"" which can confuse the reader. Make sure to clarify who you are writing about.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that detract from the overall quality of your writing. For example, ""freind"" should be ""friend,"" ""devistated"" should be ""devastated,"" and ""loses"" should be ""lost."" Take time to proofread your work for such mistakes.
   - Ensure proper use of punctuation and capitalization, particularly in names and titles.

4. **Detail and Development:**
   - While you include some interesting details about the job and experiences, they feel somewhat disconnected. Try to elaborate on key points to give context to your story. For instance, why did the friend invite her to be on the cattle boat? What were her feelings about the job?
   - Include specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate your points. Describing a particular moment during her work could make the narrative more engaging.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The essay would benefit from a concluding statement that reflects on the significance of the experiences described. What did she learn? How did this experience impact her life?

Overall, your essay has potential, but it needs more organization, clarity, and attention to detail. I encourage you to revise it by focusing on these areas. Good luck, and keep writing!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents an interesting interpretation of the painting ""Mona Lisa"" and attempts to explore the emotional nuances of the subject's expression. However, it suffers from several issues that hinder clarity and coherence. The writing lacks organization and contains numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing, which detracts from the overall effectiveness of the analysis.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Coherence:** Your essay presents some intriguing ideas about the Mona Lisa's expression and the surrounding environment. However, the overall flow is difficult to follow. Consider structuring your essay with clear introductory, body, and concluding paragraphs. This will help guide the reader through your thoughts more effectively.

2. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are several grammatical errors and typos throughout your essay (""frew"" instead of ""few,"" ""shes's"" instead of ""she's,"" ""donest"" instead of ""doesn't,"" etc.). Proofreading your work before submission can help catch these mistakes. 

3. **Word Choice:** Some phrases are awkward and could be expressed more clearly. For example, ""giving like kinda that evil eye"" could be revised to something more precise. Aim for more formal language, especially in academic writing.

4. **Depth of Analysis:** While you touch on several aspects of the painting, your analysis could benefit from deeper exploration. Consider discussing specific elements of the painting—such as the use of color, light, and composition—and how they contribute to the overall mood and message.

5. **Use of Evidence:** Your essay lacks references to the painting itself or to relevant art historical contexts. Including specific details or references to critiques of the painting can strengthen your argument and provide a more robust analysis.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- Revise your essay for grammatical accuracy and clearer phrasing.
- Organize your thoughts more logically, with distinct sections.
- Expand your analysis by including more specific observations and evidence.
- Consider seeking feedback from peers or utilizing writing resources at your institution.

With these adjustments, your essay could more effectively convey your insights about the Mona Lisa and its emotional depth. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it!"
F2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. She did not want to smile for the camra and so she did not she had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because she could not smile, she did not want to. That was the case she did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give her a smile. So they came up with a way and got her a smile for the photo and now she is smileing thanks to the computer program.

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents an interesting concept surrounding the Mona Lisa and the use of technology to alter her expression. However, there are several areas that need improvement in order to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall quality of writing.

**Strengths:**
1. **Creative Idea:** The notion of using a computer program to change the Mona Lisa's expression is imaginative and could serve as a unique angle for a discussion about art and technology.
2. **Relevant References:** The essay mentions Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Huang, connecting historical art with modern technology, which shows an attempt to blend different fields.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Coherence:** The essay lacks a clear structure. The ideas jump from one point to another without smooth transitions. It would benefit from a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
2. **Grammar and Mechanics:** There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""camra,"" ""smileing,"" ""inportant,"" ""softwear""). These distract from the content and make the essay difficult to read. Attention to spelling and proper sentence structure is essential.
3. **Redundancy:** Some points are repeated unnecessarily, such as the idea that the Mona Lisa did not want to smile. Streamlining these thoughts would make the writing more concise.
4. **Development of Ideas:** The arguments presented are underdeveloped. The essay briefly mentions emotions but does not elaborate on their significance or how they relate to the Mona Lisa or the use of technology.
5. **Punctuation and Sentence Structure:** Many sentences are run-on and lack proper punctuation, which further confuses the reader. Varying sentence lengths and using punctuation correctly will aid in clarity.

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, consider the following steps:

1. **Outline Your Ideas:** Before writing, create an outline to organize your thoughts. This will help you maintain a logical flow throughout your essay.
2. **Revise for Clarity:** Go through your essay and revise sentences to ensure they are clear and concise. Avoid redundant statements and focus on developing your main ideas.
3. **Proofread:** Take the time to check for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve the overall flow.
4. **Expand Your Ideas:** Explore the implications of using technology to alter art. Discuss the ethical considerations or the impact on the viewer's experience, which could provide depth to your argument.

Overall, while the essay presents an intriguing concept, focusing on clarity, structure, and development will significantly enhance your writing. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to seek feedback as you continue to improve your skills!"
F3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an opinion on the emotional expression of the subject in Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa."" The student argues against the interpretation of the painting's emotional content, suggesting that it is difficult to accurately gauge someone's emotions based solely on their facial expression. While the essay raises interesting points about the subjectivity of emotional interpretation, it lacks clarity, organization, and depth in its argumentation.

**Feedback:**

1. **Thesis and Clarity**: The essay lacks a clear thesis statement. While you express your disagreement with the interpretation of the Mona Lisa's emotions, it would help to clearly state your position at the beginning. A strong thesis would guide your reader through your argument.

2. **Organization**: The essay feels disjointed and could benefit from better structure. Consider organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point. For example, you might have one paragraph discussing facial expressions and emotions, another on the context of the painting, and a third on the subjectivity of interpreting art.

3. **Supporting Evidence**: While you mention the facial feedback theory, you do not provide sufficient evidence to support your claims. Incorporate examples or references to art analysis literature that could strengthen your argument. Additionally, when stating that ""faces don’t lie,"" it's helpful to explain this concept and how it relates to your argument.

4. **Grammar and Mechanics**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, ""wasnt"" should be ""wasn't,"" and ""dissapointed"" should be ""disappointed."" Proofreading for these errors would enhance the professionalism of your essay.

5. **Depth of Argument**: While you raise valid points about the difficulty of interpreting emotions, you could explore the topic further. Discussing the historical context of the painting or the artist’s intention could provide valuable insights. Moreover, consider acknowledging opposing viewpoints and addressing them to strengthen your argument.

6. **Conclusion**: The essay lacks a concluding statement that summarizes your main points and reinforces your stance. A strong conclusion would leave a lasting impression on the reader.

**Overall**: You have a unique perspective on the Mona Lisa, but focusing on organization, clarity, and supporting your arguments with evidence would greatly enhance your essay. Keep practicing your writing skills, and consider these suggestions for your next assignment!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents a clear opinion against the effectiveness of the Facial Coding System in determining a person's emotions. The student argues that one cannot truly know how someone feels without directly asking them, which is a valid point. However, the essay lacks organization, clarity, and depth. 

**Feedback:**

1. **Structure and Organization:**
   - The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider starting with an introduction that presents your main argument, followed by supporting paragraphs that elaborate on your points, and concluding with a summary of your stance. Currently, the ideas are presented in a somewhat disorganized manner.

2. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - Some sentences are long and convoluted, which can make them hard to follow. Aim to break down complex thoughts into shorter, clearer sentences. For example, instead of saying ""now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions,"" you could say, ""We typically rely on observing facial expressions rather than technology to understand how someone feels.""

3. **Grammar and Mechanics:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and typos, such as ""perent"" instead of ""percent"" and ""andd"" instead of ""and."" Proofreading your essay for spelling and punctuation errors can improve its overall quality.

4. **Depth of Argument:**
   - While you provide personal insights, the argument could be strengthened with more detailed reasoning or examples. For instance, consider discussing the limitations of the Facial Coding System in more detail or providing examples of situations where direct communication about feelings is crucial.

5. **Engagement with Sources:**
   - If you reference a specific study or artwork, like the Mona Lisa, ensure that your points are backed up with clear explanations of how they relate to your argument. You mention a percentage breakdown of emotions but don’t explain how that data was derived or why it is significant.

**Overall Suggestions:**
- Focus on organizing your thoughts more clearly and developing your ideas with supporting evidence.
- Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling to enhance readability.
- Consider providing more detailed arguments and examples to strengthen your position.

With some revisions and attention to these areas, your writing can become much more effective and persuasive. Keep practicing!"
F5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, she uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

She explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing her readers that her original claim is supported.

**Evaluation:**
This essay provides a solid analysis of the author's argument in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The student clearly articulates the main points made by the author regarding the dangers of studying Venus and effectively highlights how those dangers can be mitigated. The structure of the essay is logical, moving from identifying challenges to discussing solutions, which aligns well with the prompt.

The essay does a commendable job of summarizing key paragraphs and supporting details, demonstrating a clear understanding of the source material. The use of specific examples, such as NASA's plan with the ""blimp-like vehicle,"" adds credibility to the analysis. Additionally, the acknowledgment of the limitations of studying Venus from a distance enriches the discussion and shows critical thinking.

However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a more engaging introduction that captures the reader's attention. Further, while the student does reference specific paragraphs and points from the original essay, it would enhance the analysis to include more direct quotations or detailed descriptions of the author’s arguments. Additionally, there are minor errors, such as ""milles"" instead of ""miles"" and ""counditions"" instead of ""conditions,"" which detract from the overall professionalism of the writing.

**Feedback:**
1. **Introduction:** Consider starting with a more engaging opening statement that sets the stage for your analysis. This could be a thought-provoking question or a brief overview of why Venus is significant in the context of space exploration.

2. **Quotations and Details:** While you summarize key points well, incorporating more direct quotes from the original essay can strengthen your analysis. It can help to illustrate your points more vividly and provide a clearer connection between your commentary and the original text.

3. **Clarity and Precision:** Pay attention to spelling and grammar. Minor errors can distract the reader and undermine the professionalism of your writing. Make sure to proofread your work before submission.

4. **Conclusion:** A stronger concluding statement that reflects on the broader implications of studying Venus or reiterates the importance of overcoming challenges in space exploration could provide a more impactful closing.

Overall, this is a well-structured essay that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some refinements, it could become even more compelling and polished. Keep up the good work!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay attempts to discuss the theme of making the Mona Lisa smile again through the lens of a narrative involving a computer model and the original painting. While the central idea is interesting, the execution falls short in several areas.

**Strengths:**
1. **Theme Identification:** The student identifies the main theme of making the Mona Lisa smile again, which shows an understanding of the story's focus.
2. **Structure:** The essay attempts to reference specific paragraphs in the narrative, indicating an effort to organize thoughts around the text.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Coherence:** The sentences are often unclear and lack logical flow. For instance, phrases like ""the computer model has better details in the picture"" should be elaborated upon to clarify why these details matter. Clearer transitions between ideas would help the reader follow the argument more easily.
   
2. **Grammar and Mechanics:** There are several grammatical errors and typos (e.g., ""accomplishing"" is misspelled as ""accomplishing,"" and ""orignal"" as ""original""). Additionally, sentence structures are often awkward, making it difficult to understand the points being made.

3. **Development of Ideas:** The essay lacks depth in its analysis. Each point made is rather superficial and could benefit from further explanation. For example, the discussion about the computer model tightening Mona Lisa's lips is vague and could be explored more—why is this significant?

4. **Paragraph References:** While the essay mentions various paragraphs, it does not provide sufficient context for their content. Simply stating what paragraph discusses what without elaborating on the importance of those points weakens the argument.

5. **Conclusion:** The essay does not have a clear concluding statement or summary that encapsulates the main argument. A strong conclusion would reinforce the thesis and provide closure to the essay.

**Feedback:**

To improve your essay, focus on clarity and coherence. Start by outlining your main points and ensuring that each paragraph logically connects to the next. Pay attention to grammar and spelling, as these errors can distract readers from your message. When you mention specific paragraphs, take the time to explain their significance in relation to your thesis. Finally, consider adding a conclusion that summarizes your thoughts and reinforces your main argument. With these adjustments, your writing will be more engaging and effective!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay on the technology that reads emotional expressions. You have chosen an interesting topic and provided a specific example (the Mona Lisa) to illustrate your points. However, there are several areas that need improvement.

**Strengths:**
1. **Engaging Topic:** The subject of technology that can read emotions is relevant and intriguing, and using the Mona Lisa as an example is a creative choice.
2. **Basic Structure:** You have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, which is important for essay organization.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Coherence:** The essay lacks clarity in several sentences. For example, the phrase ""the technology fro read the emotionals expressions, its something aswesome"" is confusing and contains grammatical errors. Aim to write clear and complete sentences.
   
2. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout the essay, such as ""articule,"" ""consturucts,"" ""can be change her smile,"" and “anotner.” Reviewing basic grammar and spelling rules will help you communicate your ideas more effectively.

3. **Sentence Structure:** Many sentences are awkwardly structured or run-on. For instance, ""In conclusion, the computer now encode different emotions if write down some simple instructions"" lacks clarity. Try breaking up complex ideas into simpler sentences and using proper punctuation.

4. **Depth of Analysis:** While you mention that computers can differentiate between real and fake smiles, you could expand on this idea. Providing more detail about how this technology works or its implications would enhance your argument and make it more persuasive.

5. **Transitions and Flow:** The essay would benefit from smoother transitions between ideas. For example, when moving from discussing the Mona Lisa to computers detecting emotions, a transition sentence would help guide the reader.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Revise the essay for grammar and spelling errors. Consider using tools or resources to help with proofreading.
- Expand on your ideas and provide more detailed explanations or examples to strengthen your arguments.
- Work on your sentence structure to improve clarity. Try reading your sentences out loud to see if they flow well.
- Consider organizing your ideas into paragraphs that each focus on a single main point, which will improve the overall structure and readability of your essay.

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an interesting premise involving a discovery on Mars, but it suffers from several issues that hinder its clarity and effectiveness. The ideas are engaging, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Here are the main points of feedback:

1. **Structure and Organization**: The essay lacks a clear structure. It starts with an introduction but does not effectively transition between ideas or provide a conclusion. Organizing the essay into clear paragraphs with an introduction, body, and conclusion would enhance readability and coherence.

2. **Grammar and Mechanics**: There are numerous grammar and punctuation errors throughout the essay. For example:
   - ""me and my partner Christina was"" should be ""my partner Christina and I were.""
   - ""Christna"" is a typo; it should be ""Christina.""
   - Phrasing such as ""I asked her alot of time"" should be corrected to ""I asked her many times.""
   - Spelling mistakes like ""obivious,"" ""Shee,"" and ""living"" (should be ""living"") detract from the overall quality.

3. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, making it difficult for the reader to follow the author's train of thought. For instance, ""My thought was that it was just from natural landform but , Christina thought different she kept going on about how the 'aliens' made the mask"" could be simplified and clarified. Aim for concise sentences that convey your points clearly.

4. **Content and Analysis**: The essay presents both perspectives regarding the mask found on Mars, but it lacks depth in analyzing these viewpoints. Consider providing more context or reasoning behind Christina's belief in aliens, and perhaps delve deeper into the scientific explanation of the ""huge rock formation.""

5. **Conclusion**: The essay ends abruptly without a proper conclusion. A concluding statement summarizing the key points and reflecting on the implications of the findings would provide a stronger finish.

**Feedback for Improvement**:

- **Revising Structure**: Organize your essay into clear paragraphs: an introduction that sets the stage, body paragraphs that explore each character's viewpoint, and a conclusion that wraps up your thoughts.
  
- **Proofreading**: After writing, take the time to proofread for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Tools like spell check and grammar check can be helpful, but it's also important to read your work aloud to catch mistakes.

- **Enhancing Analysis**: Work on providing more in-depth analysis and context for the ideas presented. This will make your arguments more compelling and informative.

- **Engaging the Reader**: Consider starting with a hook that draws the reader in and makes them curious about the discovery on Mars. Using vivid descriptions could enhance engagement.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve the clarity, coherence, and overall quality of your writing. Keep practicing, and you will see progress in your writing skills!"
F9,"I need a car! why wont you get me a car? all of my friends have cars but me, why won't you get me a car!

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an interesting perspective on the desire for a car juxtaposed with environmental considerations. However, it lacks clarity, organization, and grammatical correctness, which significantly hinder its effectiveness. Here are some specific areas for improvement:

1. **Structure and Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. A more structured approach would help guide the reader through the argument.
   - Each paragraph should focus on a single idea. While there are attempts to present evidence from sources, the transitions between ideas are abrupt, making it difficult to follow the overall argument.

2. **Clarity and Focus:**
   - The central argument regarding the need for a car versus the environmental impact is muddled. It would be beneficial to clearly state your thesis in the introduction and develop it consistently throughout the essay.
   - Some sentences are confusing and seem to jump between ideas without clear connections. For example, the anecdote about your mother and the car keys feels disjointed from the main argument.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""briving,"" ""distroy,"" ""ues,"" ""Amercia,"" ""lefted,"" ""biffrents"") that detract from the essay's credibility. Proofreading for such errors would enhance the overall quality.
   - Sentence structure varies greatly, with some sentences being overly long and complex, while others are fragmented. Simplifying sentences and maintaining consistent structure could improve readability.

4. **Use of Sources:**
   - The integration of sources is a good attempt, but it lacks clarity. Each source should be properly introduced, explained, and related back to your main argument.
   - Consider summarizing the key points from each source more effectively and explaining how they support your views.

5. **Tone and Style:**
   - The essay's tone shifts between casual and formal. While it’s appropriate to express your feelings, maintaining a consistent tone throughout the essay would strengthen your argument.
   - Avoid using exclamation points excessively; they can lessen the impact of your statements.

**Feedback:**

To improve your essay, start by outlining your main argument and the supporting points you want to make. Then, draft a clear introduction that outlines your thesis. Each paragraph should focus on one idea, clearly linking back to your main argument. Pay attention to grammar and spelling, as these errors can distract the reader from your message. Proofreading your work or using grammar-checking tools can help. Finally, make sure to clearly explain the significance of the sources you mention and how they relate to your argument. With these improvements, your essay will be much more persuasive and coherent. Keep working on your writing skills; you have a solid foundation to build upon!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay addresses an important issue regarding the environmental impact of vehicles and expresses a personal opinion on the necessity of reducing carbon emissions. The student makes valid points about alternative transportation methods and the idea of government intervention to reduce vehicle use. However, the essay has several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - The essay lacks a clear structure. Consider organizing your thoughts into an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. This will help guide the reader through your argument more effectively.
   - Each paragraph should focus on a single main idea. For example, one paragraph could discuss the environmental impact of vehicles, while another could explore alternative transportation methods.

2. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling errors (e.g., ""vehical"" should be ""vehicle,"" ""artical"" should be ""article,"" ""personal"" should be spelled correctly, etc.). Proofreading your work can help catch these mistakes.
   - Sentence structure could be improved for better readability. Some sentences are run-on or lack proper punctuation, making them difficult to understand.

3. **Cohesion and Coherence:**
   - Some ideas appear abruptly without smooth transitions. For example, the switch from personal vehicles to government bans feels sudden. Use transitional phrases to connect your thoughts and make your argument flow more logically.
   - It would be beneficial to elaborate on certain ideas, such as the implications of a government ban on cars. Discuss potential benefits and challenges to provide a more balanced view.

4. **Argument Development:**
   - While you express strong opinions, it's important to support your arguments with evidence or examples. For instance, when suggesting that cities should be built closer together, you could mention studies or examples of cities that have successfully implemented this idea.
   - Consider addressing potential counterarguments. For example, discuss why some people might find personal vehicles necessary and how your proposals could accommodate their needs.

5. **Tone and Language:**
   - The tone of the essay is passionate, which is great, but be mindful of overly emotional language. Phrases like ""slapping my mother in the face"" can distract from your argument. Aim for a tone that is persuasive yet respectful.

**Overall Suggestions:**
- Revisit your essay with a focus on organization, clarity, and grammar. 
- Use specific examples and evidence to support your claims.
- Consider the audience and aim for a persuasive yet balanced tone.
- Proofread your work to eliminate spelling and grammatical errors.

By addressing these areas, your essay can become a more compelling and effective piece of writing. Keep working on developing your ideas and expressing them clearly!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay. I appreciate your effort in expressing your thoughts. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement for clarity and coherence.

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The essay lacks a clear structure. It would benefit from an introduction that states your main argument, followed by body paragraphs that support this argument, and a conclusion that summarizes your thoughts. Right now, the ideas seem jumbled together, making it hard for the reader to follow your reasoning.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as ""soemones,"" ""threw,"" ""hwat,"" ""artlicle,"" ""gunna,"" and ""certin."" These mistakes can distract readers and make your points less impactful. I recommend proofreading your work or using tools like spell check to catch these errors.

3. **Tone and Language**: The tone of the essay comes across as informal and at times, inappropriate for an academic setting. Phrases like ""who the heck cares"" and ""this is stupid"" may convey your frustration, but they do not contribute to a persuasive argument. Aim for a more respectful and academic tone in your writing.

4. **Argument Development**: While you make some valid points about the irrelevance of knowing someone's past mood, these ideas need to be developed further. Provide examples or reasoning to support your stance. For instance, you could discuss the importance of context in understanding art or emotions. Engaging with the topic more deeply will strengthen your argument.

5. **Focus on the Prompt**: Ensure that you directly address the essay prompt or question. It seems like you're reacting to a test question, but it's unclear what your main argument is. Make sure to focus on the specific topic you are asked to discuss.

In summary, while I see that you have strong feelings about the topic, your essay would greatly benefit from improved organization, clarity, grammar, and a more respectful tone. I encourage you to revise your essay with these suggestions in mind. Consider outlining your main points before writing and take the time to proofread your work. Keep practicing, and you will improve!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay attempts to engage with the theme of emotions in art, particularly focusing on the Mona Lisa and the potential of technology to understand human emotions. While the ideas presented are interesting, the execution is lacking in several key areas, including coherence, structure, grammar, and clarity.

**Feedback:**

1. **Structure and Organization**: The essay lacks a clear structure. It feels like a collection of thoughts rather than a cohesive argument. Consider organizing your essay into distinct paragraphs with clear main ideas. Start with an introduction that outlines your main argument, followed by body paragraphs that elaborate on your points, and conclude with a summary or reflection.

2. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some sentences are difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., ""Mona Lisa Smile is not real"" and ""movement of one or more miscoes is called an 'action unit'""). Strive for clarity by simplifying sentences and ensuring that each sentence logically connects to the next.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay (e.g., ""technologly,"" ""resson,"" ""peoole,"" ""Mone Lisa,"" ""wiukd""). Carefully proofread your work or use spell-check tools to catch these mistakes. Additionally, pay attention to punctuation and sentence structure.

4. **Content Development**: While you present some interesting ideas, they need to be developed further. For instance, explain how the technology you mention works and why it is significant. Use examples to support your points, and clarify your references to the Mona Lisa and her emotional expression.

5. **Argument Strength**: Your argument about the importance of understanding emotions is valid, but it's essential to provide stronger evidence and examples to back up your claims. Consider discussing specific technologies or studies that relate to emotion recognition.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion introduces new ideas rather than summarizing or reflecting on the essay's main points. Aim to restate your main argument and discuss its implications or significance in a more focused manner.

**Overall**: The essay shows potential in exploring an intriguing topic. Focus on enhancing the organization, clarity, and development of your ideas, while also addressing grammatical issues. With more attention to these areas, your writing can become more effective and persuasive. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to seek feedback on your drafts!"

Thank you for your submission! You have chosen a timely and important topic about the impact of car use on the environment and human well-being. I appreciate your effort to share your thoughts on this issue. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness of your essay.

**Strengths:**
1. **Relevant Topic**: The subject of limiting car use is significant given today's environmental concerns. You present a clear stance on the benefits of reducing car dependence.
2. **Personal Touch**: Including personal anecdotes, such as the woman from Germany, adds a relatable element to your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Organization**: The essay lacks a clear structure. Consider organizing your writing into paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point. For example, one paragraph could discuss environmental benefits, another could cover personal well-being, and a third could provide historical context.
   
2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""monther"" should be ""mother,"" ""thoes"" should be ""those,"" ""amense"" should be ""immense,"" ""transportaion"" should be ""transportation""). Proofreading your work or using spell-check tools can help catch these mistakes.

3. **Evidence and Support**: While you mention a statistic about greenhouse gases, it would strengthen your argument to provide more evidence or examples to support your claims. For instance, citing studies or providing more specific details about the town that banned cars can lend credibility to your points.

4. **Tone and Language**: Some phrases, such as ""most of us are selfish,"" can come across as accusatory and may alienate some readers. Aim for a more inclusive tone that encourages readers to consider your perspective without feeling judged.

5. **Conclusion**: The essay lacks a clear conclusion. Summarizing your main points and restating the importance of the issue at the end can help leave a lasting impression on your readers.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Start by outlining your essay to ensure a logical flow of ideas.
- Revise for grammar and spelling errors before submission.
- Use specific examples and statistics to back up your claims.
- Maintain a respectful and encouraging tone throughout.
- Conclude with a strong statement that reinforces your main argument.

Overall, with some revisions and additional detail, your essay could be more compelling and persuasive. Keep writing and refining your skills; you clearly have an important message to share!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents a personal opinion on the introduction of new technology related to emotions but lacks clarity and coherence. The main ideas are difficult to follow due to numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the overall message. There is an attempt to reference articles for support, but the evidence provided is vague and does not effectively bolster the argument. The essay also lacks a clear structure, making it challenging for the reader to understand the author's viewpoint.

   - You mention evidence from an article, but it's not clearly integrated into your argument. Instead of just stating that you got your information from an article, paraphrase or quote specific points that support your opinion. Explain how these points relate to your argument.

4. **Developing Ideas:** 
   - Expand on your ideas. For example, when you mention the lady's expression in the picture, explain why you interpret her expression that way and how it connects to your argument against new technology for emotions.

5. **Conclusion:** 
   - Your essay lacks a concluding statement. Summarize your main points and restate your opinion in a strong, conclusive manner to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Overall, focus on organizing your thoughts more clearly, improving your grammar and spelling, and providing stronger support for your arguments. Keep practicing, and your writing will improve!"
F15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay on the Facial Action Coding System. You’ve chosen an interesting and relevant topic, and it’s clear you have some thoughts about how this technology can impact human interactions. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Clarity and Organization**: The essay lacks a clear structure. Try to organize your thoughts into distinct paragraphs. A typical essay structure includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. This will help your readers follow your argument more easily.

2. **Thesis Statement**: Your main argument about the benefits and drawbacks of the Facial Action Coding System could be more clearly stated. A strong thesis statement at the end of your introduction will help guide your readers on what to expect from your essay.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are multiple grammatical errors and typos throughout your essay that detract from your message. For example, ""whats"" should be ""what's,"" ""somebody"" should be ""somebody,"" ""more easier"" should be ""easier,"" ""selfsteem"" should be ""self-esteem,"" and ""emberrass"" should be ""embarrassed."" Proofreading for spelling and grammar will enhance the clarity of your writing.

4. **Argument Development**: You mention both the positive and negative aspects of the Facial Action Coding System, which is good. However, your points need further development. Provide specific examples or evidence to support your claims. For instance, explain why understanding emotions through facial expressions is important, and elaborate on how it might make some people uncomfortable.

5. **Use of Examples**: Your reference to the Mona Lisa is interesting but could be better connected to your argument. Explain how her expression might reflect a deeper emotional state, and relate this back to the implications of using FACS in evaluating emotions. 

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should summarize your main points and reinforce your thesis. Instead of introducing new ideas, focus on what you want the reader to take away from your essay.

Overall, while you have a foundational idea, refining your essay in terms of organization, clarity, and argument development will significantly improve your writing. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to seek help with grammar and structure in future essays!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents an attempt to analyze the artwork ""Mona Lisa"" by Leonardo da Vinci, but it lacks coherence, clarity, and structure. The ideas are often unclear and lack proper organization, making it difficult for the reader to follow the student's arguments. The use of informal language and grammatical errors detracts from the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, the analysis of the artwork's colors and mood is present but not sufficiently developed or supported.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Structure:** 
   - Your essay would benefit from a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Start with a brief introduction that outlines your main point about the ""Mona Lisa"" and what you intend to discuss. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or aspect of the artwork.
   
2. **Grammar and Mechanics:**
   - Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, ""i"" should be ""I,"" and the essay should start with a capital letter. Sentences should be properly punctuated to enhance readability. Consider proofreading your work or using tools to check for grammatical errors.

3. **Coherence and Flow:**
   - Some sentences are difficult to understand due to awkward phrasing and run-on sentences. Try to break complex ideas into simpler sentences and use transitions to connect your thoughts. For instance, instead of ""but as i look at the art created by Leonardo da Vinci's i can tell his mood,"" consider rephrasing to something like, ""Upon examining Leonardo da Vinci's artwork, I can sense a complex mood.""

4. **Depth of Analysis:**
   - While you make some interesting observations about the smile and expression in the ""Mona Lisa,"" the analysis could be deepened. Explain why you think the smile conveys a sense of carelessness or mischief. Provide examples or references to support your interpretations.

5. **Use of Language:**
   - While your informal tone can be appealing, aim for a more academic tone in your writing. Avoid phrases like ""therefore its there but than it dont need to be,"" and try to express your thoughts more clearly and professionally.

In summary, while you have interesting ideas about the ""Mona Lisa,"" focusing on structure, clarity, and depth of analysis will greatly improve your writing. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback from peers or instructors before submitting your work!"
F-M2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. He did not want to smile for the camra and so he did not he had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because he could not smile, he did not want to. That was the case he did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give his a smile. So they came up with a way and got his a smile for the photo and now he is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that he would just smile but he would not have it and so they had to give his a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want his smile so they made a program and copywrited his smile and made it fake. Like they said ""he was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things.

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents an interesting concept by attempting to connect the Mona Lisa with modern technology and emotions. However, the execution is lacking in several key areas. Below are specific observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The essay lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow. The main idea seems to be about a computer program that alters the Mona Lisa's smile, but the narrative is confusing and disorganized. Consider outlining your thoughts before writing to ensure a logical flow of ideas.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous grammatical errors and spelling mistakes (e.g., ""camra,"" ""his a smile,"" ""smileing,"" ""inportant,"" ""nervisness,"" ""disguest""). Proofreading your work or using spelling and grammar check tools can help catch these errors before submission.

3. **Punctuation**: The absence of proper punctuation significantly hampers readability. Sentences are often run-on, making it challenging to understand where one thought ends and another begins. Use periods and commas appropriately to break up ideas.

4. **Content Development**: While the essay introduces an intriguing idea about Leonardo da Vinci and a modern program, it lacks depth and detail. Expand on your points; for instance, explain how the emotions are quantified and the significance of Leonardo da Vinci's original intention with the Mona Lisa.

5. **Relevance**: Some parts of the essay seem unrelated to the main topic. For example, the discussion of Thomas Huang and the emotional software could be more directly tied to the Mona Lisa's significance in art. Make sure every section contributes to the central theme.

6. **Originality and Insight**: The concept of computer programs altering historical art is original but needs a more nuanced exploration. Discuss the implications of artificial emotions in art and how they affect our understanding of the original piece.

**Feedback for Improvement:**

- **Outline**: Start with an outline to organize your thoughts and maintain a clear direction throughout the essay.
- **Research**: Provide more accurate information about Leonardo da Vinci and the Mona Lisa, ensuring that your essay reflects factual knowledge.
- **Proofread**: Always take time to review your essay for grammatical and spelling errors. Consider reading it aloud to catch awkward phrasing.
- **Expand Ideas**: Don’t just state facts—analyze them. Discuss the implications of technology in art more deeply, and consider including varying perspectives.
- **Seek Help**: Don’t hesitate to ask for guidance from teachers or peers if you’re unsure about your writing.

Overall, while the essay shows an attempt to engage with a creative idea, significant improvements in clarity, structure, and content are necessary for a stronger piece. Keep practicing, and don’t be discouraged; writing is a skill that develops over time!"
F-M3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay. You have tackled a thought-provoking topic regarding the emotions expressed in the Mona Lisa, which is a great choice for analysis. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and overall quality.

**Strengths:**
1. **Interesting Argument:** You present a unique perspective on the emotions conveyed in the Mona Lisa. It's refreshing to read an interpretation that challenges common assumptions about the painting.
2. **Engagement with the Topic:** You engage with concepts like facial feedback theory, which shows that you are considering the psychological aspects of emotion.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Organization:** The essay lacks a clear structure. It would benefit from having an introduction that outlines your main argument, body paragraphs that develop your points with evidence or examples, and a conclusion that summarizes your thoughts.
   
2. **Clarity and Coherence:** Some sentences are difficult to follow due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For instance, ""the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy..."" could be clearer if you stated, ""I disagree with the assessment that the Mona Lisa expresses specific percentages of emotions."" 

3. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are multiple spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""expiriencing,"" ""dissapointed,"" ""noticable""). Proofreading your work can help catch these mistakes, which can distract from your argument.

4. **Support for Claims:** While you present your viewpoint, it would be helpful to provide more evidence or reasoning to back up your claims. For example, when you mention that ""anyone can fake emotions,"" you could elaborate on how this applies to the artist's intentions or the context of the painting.

5. **Use of Evidence:** When you reference the emotional interpretations made by others, it would strengthen your argument to cite specific studies or sources that discuss facial feedback theory or the emotional analysis of the Mona Lisa.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
- Revise the essay for grammatical accuracy and clarity.
- Organize your thoughts into clear paragraphs, beginning with an introduction, followed by body paragraphs for each point, and concluding with a summary of your argument.
- Provide evidence to support your points, whether through existing literature or by offering more detailed analyses of the painting.
- Consider the use of transition words to improve the flow of your ideas and make connections between your points clearer.

Overall, your essay shows potential, but focusing on structure, clarity, and supporting your claims will help you develop a more compelling and polished argument. Keep working on your writing skills, and I look forward to seeing your revisions!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents a clear opinion on the effectiveness of the Facial Coding System in determining a person's emotions, arguing that one must ask the individual directly to truly understand their feelings. While the student expresses their viewpoint, the essay lacks clarity, organization, and depth of argument. There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall readability. Additionally, the essay does not engage with any counterarguments or provide supporting evidence for the claims made.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider breaking it into distinct paragraphs: an introduction that states your thesis, body paragraphs that elaborate on your points, and a conclusion that summarizes your argument.
   - Each paragraph should focus on a single idea. For instance, one paragraph could discuss the limitations of technology in understanding emotions, while another could address the importance of personal interaction.

2. **Supporting Evidence:**
   - While you express a strong opinion, your argument would be more convincing if you included examples or evidence to support your claims. For instance, referencing studies or articles that discuss the limitations of facial coding might strengthen your argument.
   - When discussing the painting of the Mona Lisa, it would be helpful to explain why you believe the interpretations of its emotional content are subjective and how this supports your overall argument.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and typos, such as “perent” instead of “percent” and “his” instead of “him.” Proofreading your work for such mistakes will improve its professionalism.
   - Consider varying your sentence structure to enhance readability. Some sentences are overly long and would benefit from being broken into shorter, clearer statements.

4. **Engagement with Counterarguments:**
   - Acknowledging the validity of the Facial Coding System’s approach, even briefly, could strengthen your argument. Addressing potential counterpoints shows critical thinking and enhances the overall discussion.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion is present, but it could be more impactful. Summarizing your main points succinctly and reiterating the significance of your argument will leave a stronger impression on the reader.

Overall, you have a solid foundation for your argument, but focusing on organization, clarity, and detailed support will enhance your writing significantly. Keep practicing, and consider these suggestions for your next essay!"

Despite this, the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, he uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

He explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, he was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing his readers that his original claim is supported.

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents a clear understanding of the central argument in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" and effectively summarizes the author's points about the dangers of studying Venus and the proposed solutions. The structure of the essay is logical, with each paragraph addressing a specific aspect of the author’s argument. However, several areas could be improved to enhance clarity, depth, and overall quality.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity and Structure:** 
   - The essay does a good job of summarizing the author's main points. However, some sentences could be clearer. For example, instead of ""the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" you could say ""the author argues that the scientific benefits of studying Venus outweigh the inherent dangers."" This provides a stronger and more assertive claim.
   - Consider using transition phrases to improve the flow between paragraphs and ideas, making it easier for the reader to follow the author's argument.

2. **Detail and Depth:**
   - While you mention that the author provides solutions to the dangers of Venus, it would strengthen your analysis to include more specific examples or quotes from the text. This would provide evidence for your claims and demonstrate a deeper engagement with the material.
   - Expand on the implications of studying Venus. Why is it important? What could we learn? Adding this context could enhance the overall argument and provide more depth to your analysis.

3. **Grammar and Mechanics:**
   - There are a few spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""milles"" (should be ""miles"") and ""counditions"" (should be ""conditions""). Proofreading for these minor errors would enhance the professionalism of your writing.
   - Additionally, some sentences are somewhat repetitive. For example, mentioning that the author effectively supports his idea multiple times could be streamlined to avoid redundancy.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion reiterates the main point but could be more impactful. Consider summarizing the significance of the exploration of Venus and why continuing to study such a dangerous environment is crucial for future scientific advancements.

The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens his lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of his picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence. Inside Paragraph 4 it is telling about how the expression of the real face is inside the art of Mona Lisa.]""

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents an interesting interpretation of the topic focused on the ""Mona Lisa"" and the concept of making her smile again. However, it suffers from several issues that affect clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

**Strengths:**

1. **Topic Relevance:** The essay addresses the chosen topic of the ""Mona Lisa"" and the idea of expressing emotions through art.
2. **Structure:** The essay attempts to reference various paragraphs, which shows an effort to organize thoughts.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Clarity and Coherence:** The main argument is unclear, and many sentences are difficult to follow. For instance, phrases like ""the computer model picture is a little bit better than the original one"" could be articulated more clearly. It's not evident why the computer model is considered superior, so this point needs more explanation.

2. **Grammar and Mechanics:** There are numerous grammatical errors, including misspellings (e.g., ""accomplishing,"" ""original,"" ""Mona""). Additionally, sentence structure is often awkward and can lead to confusion. For example, ""they painted a picture of his for accomplishing the process of the model of a great model he smiled for that picture"" is particularly convoluted.

3. **Development of Ideas:** The essay lacks depth in exploring the ideas presented. More elaboration on how the computer model enhances the representation of emotions would strengthen the argument. Each paragraph should also be developed with clearer topic sentences and supporting details.

4. **Use of Evidence:** The essay references different paragraphs but does not provide any direct quotes or specific evidence to support claims. This weakens the argument and makes it less persuasive.

5. **Conclusion and Overall Flow:** The essay does not have a clear conclusion, which leaves the reader without a sense of closure. A strong concluding statement summarizing the main points would enhance the overall effectiveness of the essay.

**Feedback:**

To improve your essay, consider the following steps:

1. **Clarify Your Main Argument:** Clearly state your thesis in the introduction, and make sure every paragraph supports this central idea.

2. **Enhance Sentence Structure:** Work on your grammar and sentence construction. Aim for clarity and simplicity to convey your ideas effectively.

3. **Expand Your Ideas:** Take time to explain your points in more detail. Use examples and evidence to back up your claims, making your argument more compelling.

4. **Proofread Your Work:** Always check for spelling and grammatical errors before submitting. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch awkward phrases and improve overall flow.

5. **Conclude Effectively:** Make sure to include a conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your thesis.

With these revisions, your essay can become more effective and engaging. Keep practicing your writing skills!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

This essay presents an interesting topic about technology's ability to read emotional expressions, particularly using the example of the Mona Lisa. However, it has several areas that need improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, grammar, and overall structure.

**Strengths:**
1. **Interesting Topic**: The essay discusses a relevant and engaging subject that connects technology with art.
2. **Use of Examples**: The mention of the Mona Lisa adds depth and context to the discussion, illustrating how emotional expressions can be interpreted.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous grammatical errors and spelling mistakes throughout the essay. For example, ""fro"" should be ""for,"" ""articule"" should be ""article,"" and ""aswesome"" should be ""awesome."" These errors can distract the reader and detract from the credibility of the writing.

2. **Sentence Structure**: Many sentences are awkwardly constructed or too lengthy, making them difficult to follow. Breaking up complex sentences and varying sentence structure can improve readability.

3. **Clarity and Coherence**: Some ideas are not clearly articulated. For instance, the explanation of how computers can distinguish between real and fake smiles is vague. Providing more detail and clearer examples would enhance understanding.

4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion is somewhat abrupt and does not effectively summarize the main points of the essay. A stronger conclusion could reinforce the significance of the technology discussed and its implications for understanding human emotions.

5. **Formatting and Punctuation**: Inconsistent use of punctuation and capitalization (e.g., ""his smile,"" ""the Mona Lisa"") can confuse readers. Proper formatting would enhance the overall presentation.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Revise the essay to correct grammar and spelling errors, ensuring clarity and correctness.
- Organize the ideas more logically, with clear transitions between points.
- Expand on key ideas, such as how technology analyzes emotional expressions, to provide a more thorough explanation.
- Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the main points and offering insights into the broader implications of the technology discussed.

Overall, while the essay has potential, it requires significant revisions to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall quality. Keep working on these skills, and your writing will improve!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for your submission! You've made an interesting attempt to explore a creative idea about the discovery of a mask on Mars. I appreciate your engagement with the topic and the way you presented the differing opinions between you and Christina. However, there are several areas where you can improve your essay to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall quality.

1. **Structure and Organization:** 
   - Your essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Consider starting with an introductory sentence that sets the stage for your discussion about the mask on Mars. 
   - You can improve the flow of your ideas by organizing your paragraphs better. For example, one paragraph could focus on your perspective, another on Christina's perspective, and a final paragraph to discuss the conclusion drawn by NASA.

2. **Clarity and Grammar:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that make it difficult to understand your points. For instance, ""me and my partner Christina was"" should be ""my partner Christina and I were.""
   - Be careful with punctuation. For example, there should not be a space before commas and periods. 
   - Use complete sentences, and double-check your spelling (e.g., ""obivious"" should be ""obvious,"" ""Christna"" should be ""Christina,"" and ""his"" should be ""him"").

3. **Use of Evidence:**
   - You included some relevant facts from a source, but it would strengthen your argument to provide a bit more context or analysis about the significance of NASA's findings. Discuss how the discovery reflects human curiosity or the tendency to project our imaginations onto unexplained phenomena.

4. **Character Development:**
   - You mention Christina's perspective but do not give much depth to his character or reasoning. It might be helpful to elaborate on why he believes what he does, which could make the essay more engaging.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion could be more impactful. Instead of just restating the facts, you might want to reflect on what this discovery means for humanity's understanding of Mars or discuss the importance of scientific inquiry.

Overall, you've initiated an interesting discussion, but you need to work on your writing mechanics, organization, and depth of analysis. I encourage you to revise your essay with these suggestions in mind. Keep practicing, and I look forward to seeing your improvements in future writing!"

**Evaluation:**

The essay presents a personal narrative that attempts to connect the desire for a car with broader environmental concerns. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

**Strengths:**
1. **Personal Connection:** The essay opens with a relatable scenario that many young people face—the desire for independence through car ownership. This personal touch can engage readers.
2. **Awareness of Environmental Issues:** The essay references relevant statistics and sources to highlight the impact of cars on greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating an awareness of environmental issues.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Structure and Organization:** The essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps between personal anecdotes and statistics without smooth transitions or a coherent flow. It would benefit from a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
   
2. **Clarity and Grammar:** There are numerous grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrases (e.g., ""mentleman,"" ""biving,"" ""distroy,"" ""importanat,"" ""lefted""). These detract from the clarity of your ideas. Proofreading and editing for grammar and spelling are essential.

3. **Development of Ideas:** While the essay touches on important themes, it does not fully develop them. For instance, the connection between the personal desire for a car and the environmental impact could be explored more deeply. Why is it important to you personally? How does that relate to the broader issue? 

4. **Use of Sources:** The essay references different sources but does not integrate them effectively into the argument. It would be beneficial to explain how each source supports your claims more clearly, rather than simply stating facts.

5. **Conclusion:** The essay lacks a strong conclusion. Summarizing the main points and reflecting on the implications of your argument would provide a more satisfying ending.

**Feedback:**
- Take the time to outline your essay before writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and create a logical flow.
- Focus on clarity and coherence. Ensure that each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next.
- Proofread your work for grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Consider using tools or asking someone else to review your writing.
- Expand on your ideas. Make connections between your personal experiences and the broader themes you wish to discuss.
- Conclude your essay with a strong statement that encapsulates your thoughts and encourages readers to consider the implications of car ownership and environmental responsibility.

Overall, while you have a good foundation with your personal narrative and awareness of environmental issues, significant revisions are needed to improve clarity, coherence, and depth. Keep working on your writing skills!"

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents a passionate perspective on the issue of vehicle usage and its impact on carbon emissions and the environment. However, it has several areas that need significant improvement in clarity, structure, grammar, and argumentation. Here are some specific points to consider:

**Strengths:**
1. **Passion for the Topic:** The essay demonstrates strong feelings about environmental issues, which can engage readers and highlight the importance of the subject.
2. **Call to Action:** The proposal for a ban on cars on certain days shows a creative approach to addressing the problem, encouraging readers to think about practical solutions.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Focus:** The essay lacks a clear thesis statement. A more defined central argument would help guide the reader through the points being made. It would also benefit from a more structured format, including an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
   
2. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay (e.g., ""vehicals"" should be ""vehicles""; ""artical"" should be ""article""; ""personal vehicals"" should be ""personal vehicles""; ""differnce"" should be ""difference""; ""goverment"" should be ""government""; ""bput"" should be ""put""; ""emmisons"" should be ""emissions""; ""distroying"" should be ""destroying""; ""the dont"" should be ""they don't""). Proofreading for these errors is essential to improve readability and professionalism.

3. **Argument Development:** Some arguments are presented but not fully developed. For example, while you mention building cities closer together, you could expand on how this would work and its potential benefits. Providing evidence or examples to support your claims would strengthen your argument.

4. **Tone and Language:** The tone can come off as overly emotional and confrontational at times (e.g., comparing environmental neglect to slapping a mother). While it's important to convey urgency, it's also essential to maintain a respectful and constructive tone to engage readers effectively.

5. **Logical Flow:** The essay jumps between ideas without smooth transitions. Organizing the content into distinct sections could help maintain logical flow and coherence.

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, consider the following steps:
- Start with a clear thesis statement that outlines your main argument.
- Organize your ideas into paragraphs, each focusing on a single point that supports your thesis.
- Proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors, and consider using tools like spell check or grammar check to assist you.
- Use examples and evidence to support your points, and strive for a respectful and constructive tone throughout your writing.

By addressing these areas, you can create a more coherent, persuasive, and polished essay. Keep writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback on future drafts!"

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay. While I appreciate your willingness to express your thoughts, there are several areas that need improvement. Here’s a breakdown of your essay and some suggestions for enhancing your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay lacks a clear structure or argument. It seems to jump between thoughts and ideas without a clear flow. Try to organize your ideas logically. Start with an introduction that states your main point, followed by body paragraphs that support your argument, and conclude with a summary of your thoughts.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""soemones,"" ""threw,"" ""artlicle,"" ""past,"" ""gunna""). These mistakes can distract the reader and make your writing difficult to understand. Always proofread your work or use tools to help catch these errors.

3. **Tone and Formality**: The tone of your essay feels informal, and at times, it comes across as disrespectful (e.g., ""who the heck cares,"" ""this is stupid""). In academic writing, it's important to maintain a respectful and formal tone, even if you disagree with the prompt or topic.

4. **Argument Development**: You mention that people should not care about others' moods or past experiences. This is an interesting perspective, but you need to develop your argument further. Provide reasons or examples to support your viewpoint, and explain why understanding emotions might be important in certain contexts.

5. **Relevance to the Prompt**: It seems that your essay diverges from the expected response to the prompt. Make sure to stay focused on what is being asked and address it directly.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:

- **Outline Your Ideas**: Before writing, outline your main points. This will help you stay organized and focused.
- **Work on Language Skills**: Consider spending time on grammar and vocabulary exercises. This will enhance your writing and make it more engaging.
- **Practice Different Tones**: Try writing in different styles, including formal academic writing, to get accustomed to varying your tone based on the audience.
- **Read More**: Reading essays or articles can give you a sense of how to structure arguments and express ideas clearly.

In conclusion, I encourage you to take the feedback into account and revise your essay. With more attention to structure, clarity, and tone, you can greatly improve your writing skills. Keep practicing!"
F-M12,"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent man. we all kmow he was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked his if he was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show his emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up he would always say he was fine. he wiukd always bave a smile in the back of his head. but he knew no one would ever understand his so he never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling he always felt.

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show his emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up he would always say he was fine. he wiukd always bave a smile in the back of his head. but he knew no one would ever understand his so he never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling he always felt.               ]""

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for submitting your essay. You have made an interesting attempt to discuss the intersection of technology and emotional expression, particularly in relation to the Mona Lisa. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness.

**Strengths:**
1. **Interesting Topic:** Your choice to explore how technology can analyze emotions, especially in relation to a famous artwork like the Mona Lisa, is intriguing and relevant.
2. **Personal Engagement:** You express a personal opinion about the topic, which is a good way to engage the reader and make your argument more relatable.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Organization and Structure:** The essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps between ideas without smooth transitions. Consider organizing your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point (introduction, body, conclusion).
   
2. **Clarity and Coherence:** Some sentences are difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., ""Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent man""). Be sure to revise your sentences for clarity. It might help to read your work out loud to catch confusing parts.

3. **Spelling and Grammar:** There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""tecnologly,"" ""resson,"" ""peecent,"" ""speak up""). Proofreading your essay before submission can help eliminate these issues. Consider using spell check tools or asking someone to review your work.

4. **Use of Evidence:** While you mention emotions and reference Ekman’s classification, your argument would benefit from clearer explanations and examples. Providing more context about how technology can help identify emotions would strengthen your essay.

5. **Focus on the Topic:** Some parts of your essay stray from the main topic, particularly when discussing the Mona Lisa as a ""strong independent man."" This seems to confuse the argument. Make sure that every part of your essay relates back to your main thesis.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
- Start with a clear thesis statement in your introduction that outlines your main argument.
- Organize your ideas into paragraphs, each with a clear main idea and supporting details.
- Revise for spelling and grammar; consider using tools or resources to help with this.
- Provide specific examples of how technology can help us understand emotions better, and connect these examples back to your discussion of the Mona Lisa.
- Conclude with a strong statement that summarizes your main points and reflects on the implications of your argument.

Overall, you have a good concept to work with, but with careful revision and attention to detail, you can enhance your essay significantly. Keep writing, and don't hesitate to ask for help if needed!"
F-M13,"By limiting car use not only does it help monther earth, by extracting all thoes harmful chemicals in the air.

**Evaluation:**

This essay presents a relevant and important topic regarding the impact of car usage on the environment and personal well-being. However, it suffers from several significant issues that hinder its effectiveness.

**Strengths:**
1. **Topic Relevance:** The essay addresses a pressing issue – the environmental impact of car usage and the benefits of limiting it.
2. **Personal Anecdote:** The reference to the individual from VAUBA, Germany adds a personal touch and supports the argument that reducing car use can lead to improved happiness.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Structure:** The essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps between ideas without smooth transitions or a coherent flow. A more defined introduction, body, and conclusion would help the reader follow the argument more easily.
   
2. **Spelling and Grammar:** There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., ""monther"" should be ""mother,"" ""thoes"" should be ""those,"" ""amense"" should be ""immense,"" ""transportaion"" should be ""transportation,"" etc.). These mistakes distract from the content and undermine the writer's credibility.

3. **Evidence and Support:** While the essay mentions experts and provides a quote, it lacks sufficient evidence to support the claims made. Citing more studies, statistics, or examples would strengthen the argument.

4. **Tone and Formality:** The essay sometimes uses informal language (e.g., ""just so used to,"" ""selfish enough,"" ""Can you do that?""). A more formal tone would be appropriate for an academic essay.

5. **Conclusion:** The essay ends abruptly without a strong concluding statement that summarizes the main points or calls for action.

**Feedback:**
To improve your essay, consider the following steps:

1. **Organize your thoughts:** Start with a clear thesis statement that outlines your main argument. Organize your essay into an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.

2. **Proofread your work:** Take the time to check for spelling and grammatical errors. Reading your essay aloud can help identify awkward phrasing or mistakes.

3. **Support your claims:** Incorporate more evidence and examples to back up your assertions. This could include statistics about car emissions, studies on air quality, or more personal anecdotes.

4. **Use a formal tone:** Avoid informal language and strive for a more academic tone throughout your writing.

5. **Conclude effectively:** End with a strong conclusion that summarizes your main points and emphasizes the importance of limiting car use for both the environment and personal well-being.

With these improvements, your essay can become a more compelling and effective piece. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback on your revisions!"

**Evaluation:**
The essay presents an interesting perspective on the potential implications of new technology that detects emotions. However, it faces several challenges that hinder its clarity and effectiveness in conveying the argument. 

**Strengths:**
1. **Personal Perspective**: The essay attempts to express a personal opinion on the topic, which is essential in persuasive writing. The student's feelings about emotional technology are clear.
2. **Reference to Source Material**: The student mentions an article and attempts to draw evidence from it, which is a good practice in supporting an argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Coherence**: The essay lacks organization and coherence. Ideas are presented in a jumbled manner, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument. Clear topic sentences and transitions between ideas would help improve the flow.
2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the essay (e.g., ""technologie,"" ""probabaly,"" ""no,"" ""sonmbody,"" ""iknow,"" ""opion,"" ""mentleman""). These mistakes detract from the overall professionalism and readability of the writing. Proofreading and using spell-check tools could greatly enhance the quality of the work.
3. **Depth of Analysis**: The essay touches on important themes, such as emotional privacy and the potential for misinterpretation of feelings through technology. However, these points are not explored in depth. Providing more detailed explanations, examples, and analysis would strengthen the argument.
4. **Support for Claims**: While the student references an article, the evidence is vague and not well integrated into the argument. Direct quotes or paraphrased sections from the article would provide stronger support for the points being made.
5. **Conclusion**: The essay lacks a clear conclusion that summarizes the main points and reinforces the writer's opinion. A strong conclusion would help to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

**Feedback:**
To improve this essay, consider the following steps:
- **Organize Your Ideas**: Start with an introduction that clearly states your opinion. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a single point, and use transitions to guide the reader through your argument.
- **Proofread for Errors**: Take the time to check your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing.
- **Expand on Your Ideas**: Provide more detailed explanations and examples to support your points. This will help clarify your argument and make it more persuasive.
- **Use Evidence Effectively**: Incorporate direct quotes or specific references from the article to strengthen your claims, and explain how they relate to your argument.
- **Conclude Strongly**: End with a conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your opinion, leaving the reader with a clear understanding of your stance.

With these improvements, your writing can become more effective and impactful. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback along the way!"
F-M15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe he never talk about how he felt when the picture was took and people just say he was happy and he wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

**Evaluation and Feedback:**

Thank you for your submission! Your essay presents an interesting perspective on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and its implications for understanding emotions. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness. Here are my specific comments:

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - The essay lacks a clear introduction, body, and conclusion structure. A strong introduction should state your main argument, and subsequent paragraphs should develop your ideas clearly.
   - Consider breaking your thoughts into separate paragraphs. Each paragraph should focus on a single point to improve readability.

2. **Content and Argumentation:**
   - You mention that FACS can help understand emotions, but your argument about it making people uncomfortable feels underdeveloped. Elaborate on this point—why might someone feel ashamed or embarrassed? Providing examples or exploring these emotions further would strengthen your argument.
   - The reference to the Mona Lisa is intriguing, but it is unclear how it supports your main argument. Clarify how this example relates to your thesis about FACS.

3. **Language and Grammar:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and typos that hinder comprehension. For example, ""whats"" should be ""what's,"" ""more easier"" should be ""easier,"" ""sombody"" should be ""somebody,"" and ""selfsteem"" should be ""self-esteem.""
   - Be mindful of punctuation; some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for clarity.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion reiterates the main points but lacks a strong closing statement. Consider summarizing your key arguments and leaving the reader with a thought-provoking idea or question.

5. **Overall Tone:**
   - The tone of your essay feels somewhat informal. Strive for a more academic tone and avoid phrases like ""just making things up that are not true."" This can be rephrased to sound more professional.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Revise your essay for clarity and structure. Use paragraphs to separate different ideas.
- Develop your arguments more fully and provide specific examples to support your claims.
- Proofread your work to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.
- Aim for a more formal tone to enhance the professionalism of your writing.

Keep practicing, and I look forward to seeing your improvements in future essays!"
