Your thoughts on Luke's desire to join the program shine through, but the overall clarity and structure of your essay need some work. It feels like you have some good ideas, but they get a bit lost in the way they’re presented. 

 

One of the strengths of your essay is your enthusiasm for Luke and his aspirations. You clearly want to convey that he’s a good person and has a strong desire to follow his dreams, which is great! However, the essay could benefit from a more organized approach. Right now, some sentences are a bit jumbled, and there are several spelling and grammatical errors that make it hard to follow your ideas. Focusing on clarity and coherence will help your message come across more effectively.

 

When it comes to your argument, you touch on some important points about Luke's character and motivation. However, your examples could be more specific to strengthen your argument. For instance, instead of saying ""he might help,"" think about what specific actions he could take or what he might learn from the program that would be beneficial. This will make your essay more convincing and help your reader understand why this choice is significant for Luke.

 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a lively voice that comes through in your writing. That energy is a positive aspect! Still, there are quite a few spelling mistakes (like ""actullay"" and ""dissions"") and grammatical issues that distract from your message. It's important to proofread your work carefully to catch these errors. Additionally, try to vary your sentence structure a bit more to keep the reader engaged. 

 

To enhance your essay, I suggest starting with a clear thesis statement that outlines what you will discuss about Luke's decision. Then, organize your paragraphs to focus on one main idea each, providing specific examples that support your claims. Make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar before submitting your work. If you’re interested in this topic, think about what specific experiences or knowledge you have that could enrich your argument. This will not only make your essay stronger but also reflect your genuine interest in the subject. Keep working on it; I can see that you have the potential to create a compelling essay!"
M2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

What stands out is your clear interest in the topic of being a sea-going cowboy, particularly in the context of World War II. It’s great to see you engaging with historical events and reflecting on the dangers involved. However, the essay’s structure and clarity need significant improvement for your ideas to shine through more effectively.

One strength is your attempt to provide examples from the text, like the mention of Luke's injuries and the role call. These details can help illustrate your points. However, the essay suffers from a lack of organization and clarity. For instance, there are several misspellings and grammatical errors that distract from your message. It would also benefit from clearer transitions between your ideas and paragraphs, as some thoughts feel jumbled together.

When it comes to your argument, you present some valid points about the risks of being a sea-going cowboy, but they could use more development. It’s important to clearly state your main arguments and support them with more thorough explanations or additional examples. You mention Luke’s injuries, but diving deeper into how these experiences affected him or the implications of his decisions could strengthen your case significantly.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a willingness to tackle a complex topic, which is commendable. However, your writing needs more attention to detail. There are issues with spelling and punctuation, such as ""slinked"" instead of ""sunk"" and ""acording"" instead of ""according."" These mistakes can undermine your credibility as a writer. On the flip side, your conversational tone makes the essay relatable, which is a positive aspect.

To enhance your essay, I recommend focusing on a clearer structure. Consider outlining your main points before you begin writing, which can help keep your thoughts organized. Pay special attention to proofreading your work for spelling and grammatical errors; reading it out loud can help catch mistakes. Lastly, try to develop your arguments further by connecting your examples back to your main thesis more explicitly. This will not only clarify your writing but also make your argument more persuasive.

Overall, your enthusiasm for the topic is evident, and with some focused revisions, your essay can really improve. Keep working at it!"

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowboys program and your desire to support Luke. You clearly have some personal interest in the topic, which is great! It’s clear that you enjoy thinking about the adventures and responsibilities involved in the program, and that enthusiasm can be a powerful element in your writing.

However, there are some areas that need improvement. First, your essay would benefit from clearer organization and structure. Right now, it feels a bit like a stream of thoughts rather than a well-formed argument. You have some interesting ideas about Luke’s experiences, but they get a bit jumbled together, making it hard for the reader to follow your main points. It might help to break your essay into paragraphs, each focusing on one specific idea or aspect of Luke’s journey.

Your argument could be strengthened by providing more specific examples and details. For instance, you mention that Luke enjoys his job and takes care of animals, but it would be helpful to elaborate on what that means. What kinds of animals does he care for? What specific tasks does he perform? The more details you include, the more vivid your argument will become. Also, try to avoid run-on sentences; breaking them up can make your writing clearer and more impactful.

In terms of writing competency and style, you’ve got some great ideas, but there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that detract from your message. For example, you wrote phrases like “he like's” and “he get's,” which should be “he likes” and “he gets.” Paying attention to these small details will help your writing come across as more polished. Additionally, work on your sentence structure; mixing shorter sentences with longer ones can create a more engaging rhythm in your writing.

Given your interest in the Seagoing Cowboys program, I encourage you to dive deeper into what makes it special. Researching the program further could provide you with more insights and examples to support your points. Try writing an outline before you start your next essay; this can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that you cover all the points you want to make.

Overall, I see a lot of potential in your writing. With some revisions and attention to detail, you can develop a stronger essay that fully conveys your thoughts and feelings about the topic. Keep working on it!"

What stands out is your enthusiasm for the job you’re discussing. It’s clear that you have a passion for this line of work, and I appreciate that you want to share why you think others should consider it too. The idea of adventure and enjoying life while doing what you love is a strong message in your writing, and it’s great to see that you’re thinking about how jobs can impact our lives. 

However, there are several areas where your writing could improve. First, the organization of your ideas feels a bit scattered. It can be hard for readers to follow your main points when they jump around. Try to create a clearer structure in your essays. For example, you might start with an introduction that outlines your main argument, followed by paragraphs that explore each point in detail, before concluding with a summary of your thoughts. 

Your argument is based on the idea that people should do jobs they enjoy, but it would be stronger if you included specific examples or stories to illustrate your points. You mention someone who chose to be a cowboy and went on adventures, but it would help to describe what specific experiences made that job enjoyable for him. This would add depth to your argument and help readers connect with your points more personally.

In terms of writing competency and style, I can see you have a good grasp of the ideas you want to express, but the clarity of your writing needs some work. There are quite a few spelling and grammar mistakes, like “go acrossed the ocean” instead of “go across the ocean,” and phrases that could be clearer, like “he thinks it like lat job.” Focusing on proofreading your work before submitting it could really help catch these errors. 

One of your strengths is your ability to convey emotion and passion for the topic. This is a powerful tool in writing! To build on this, I recommend practicing writing more structured drafts where you focus on one idea per paragraph. Also, try to read more essays or articles related to your topic—this will help you see how other writers organize their thoughts and present arguments. 

As you work on your next essay, consider creating an outline before you start writing. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure you’re conveying your main ideas in a logical way. Also, remember to take a little time to edit your work for spelling and grammar mistakes. Keep writing, and I’m excited to see how your skills develop!"
M5,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

One of the first things I noticed is your enthusiasm for the topic of being a seagoing cowboy. It’s clear you find this idea exciting, and that energy comes through in your writing. Your interest in the experiences of the main character adds a personal touch, making it more engaging to read.

You did a great job highlighting some of the key experiences that Luke had, like his trips to places like Greece and China. These details help paint a picture of the life of a seagoing cowboy, and it's interesting to see how you connected them to the idea of adventure and growth. However, there are several areas where you could improve. For one, your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Right now, it feels a bit scattered, jumping between points without smooth transitions. Try structuring it around a few main ideas and make sure each paragraph focuses on one of those ideas.

When it comes to argumentation, you touched on some important points, like Luke’s record for trips and the fun he had aboard the ship. However, your essay would be stronger if you provided more analysis or explanation about why these details matter. For instance, why is it significant that he holds the record? What does that say about the opportunities available to others? Engaging more deeply with these questions can elevate your writing.

In terms of writing style, your voice is coming through, which is wonderful. However, there are quite a few grammatical errors and typos that detract from your overall message. Phrases like “havig” instead of “having” and “satses” instead of “states” can confuse readers and take away from your credibility. Proofreading your work before submitting it could help catch these mistakes.

Given your clear interest in the topic, I recommend diving even deeper into what it means to be a seagoing cowboy. Think about what life lessons or values can be learned from this experience. You might also consider adding quotes or specific examples from the text that support your points more robustly. This would not only strengthen your argument but also demonstrate your understanding of the text.

Overall, you have a solid foundation here, but with some additional organization, clearer arguments, and careful proofreading, you could really enhance your essay. Keep up the good work and keep writing!"
M6,"Luke Bomberger reasons to join were. He was working two part time jobs at the grocrey store and the bank and. It was a opportunity of a life time so he had to take it his life was just begning When his freind wanted him to join.He was only 18 whe he was drafted to be a seagoing cowboy.

Right off the bat, it's clear that you have an interesting story to tell about Luke Bomberger's experiences as a seagoing cowboy. The idea of blending adventure and hard work is captivating, and it sounds like Luke had quite the journey. However, the writing could benefit from more structure and clarity to really bring these ideas to life.

One of the strengths of your essay is the engaging concept of life at sea and the camaraderie among the crew. It gives a glimpse into what Luke's life might have been like, which is great. However, there are several areas for improvement. For instance, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message, like ""grocrey"" instead of ""grocery"" and ""freind"" instead of ""friend."" Additionally, some sentences are a bit choppy or incomplete, which makes it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts. Try to expand on your ideas more fully and ensure each sentence flows into the next.

As for your argument and use of examples, you have a good starting point with Luke's experiences, but you could delve deeper into why these experiences were meaningful to him and how they shaped his character. The anecdote about being a night watchman is intriguing, but it could use more detail to really capture the reader's attention. What did he learn from that experience? How did it affect him personally? Adding these reflections would strengthen your essay significantly.

Regarding your writing ability, you clearly have a passion for the subject, but the execution needs some work. Your enthusiasm shines through, especially since you seem interested in this topic. However, the writing lacks polish and clarity, which can make it hard for the reader to engage fully. 

To improve, I recommend focusing on proofreading your work for spelling and grammar issues. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. Additionally, consider outlining your essay before writing it to help organize your thoughts more clearly. This will allow you to present your ideas in a more structured way, making it easier for the reader to follow your argument. Lastly, don’t hesitate to expand on your examples—giving more detail will help illustrate your points and make them more impactful. Keep working at it!"
M7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5.

It's clear that you have a genuine enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowboys program, and your interest really shines through your writing. You provide a personal connection, like mentioning how Luke’s experiences changed his life, which makes your argument relatable and engaging.

However, there are several areas where you could improve. For one, the essay has some spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, such as ""exsperences"" instead of ""experiences"" and ""abourd"" instead of ""aboard."" These small issues can distract the reader from your main points. Additionally, the structure could be more organized. Try to ensure that each paragraph has a clear focus and flows logically from one to the next. 

Your argument is compelling, especially when you discuss how Luke's participation in the program impacted his descendants. However, it would be even stronger if you included some more specific examples or details about the program's benefits. You mention activities like baseball and volleyball, but elaborating on how these experiences foster teamwork or create lasting memories would enhance your argument. 

In terms of writing competency, you clearly have a good grasp of the topic and a passion for it, which is fantastic. However, your writing could benefit from more careful proofreading and attention to detail. Strengths include your ability to connect emotionally with the subject matter, while weaknesses lie in grammar and organization.

To develop your skills further, I recommend taking a bit more time to revise your essays before submission. Read your work aloud to catch any awkward phrasing or errors. Additionally, consider creating an outline before you start writing to help organize your thoughts and ensure that each point you make supports your overall argument. 

Overall, with a little more attention to detail and structure, I believe your writing can become even more impactful. Keep exploring your interests, and let that passion guide your writing!"
M8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.","

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your strong engagement with the idea of how the story could shift if told in first person. You clearly have a lot of thoughts about Luke's feelings and experiences, and it's great to see you exploring those aspects. Your enthusiasm for the topic really shines through, which is fantastic!

However, there are some areas where you can improve. First, your essay would benefit from clearer organization. Right now, it feels a bit like a stream of consciousness, jumping from one idea to another without a clear structure. Try grouping your thoughts into paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of Luke's character or experiences. This will help your readers follow your argument more easily. Also, pay attention to your grammar and spelling. For example, ""saide"" should be ""said,"" and ""Acording"" should be ""According."" Taking time to proofread will go a long way in making your writing clearer.

When it comes to your argument, you have some good ideas, but they could be strengthened with more specific examples from the text. You mention several interesting points about what Luke might think or feel, but if you could tie these ideas back to specific events or quotes from the story, it would make your argument much more convincing. For instance, instead of just saying he would have liked the adventure, you could refer to a scene where he demonstrates that joy.

In terms of your writing ability, you show a lot of potential and a genuine interest in the topic, which is great for developing your skills further. It's clear that you have a passion for storytelling. However, focusing on clarity and structure will be essential as you continue to write. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest starting with an outline to organize your thoughts. This will help you create a logical flow from one point to the next. Additionally, consider revising your essay by breaking it into paragraphs, each with a clear main idea. Don't forget to proofread for spelling and grammar mistakes. Lastly, try to include more textual evidence to support your claims; this will bolster your argument and show your understanding of the material. Keep writing, and I look forward to seeing how you develop these ideas further!"

Right off the bat, I appreciate your effort in telling the story of Luke Bomberger and his experiences during World War II. You’ve chosen an interesting character and a significant historical event, which sets a strong foundation for your writing. However, the overall clarity and structure of your essay need improvement. It can be a bit challenging to follow your ideas because of the way they are presented.

One of the strengths of your essay is your enthusiasm for the topic. You clearly have a lot of ideas and emotions tied to Luke's story, which is great! However, there are several areas where you could improve. For instance, your sentences often run on without proper punctuation, making it hard for the reader to catch the flow of your thoughts. Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your overall message. Focusing on these aspects will help your writing become more polished and easier to understand.

As for your argument, you have a good foundation, but it lacks organization and clear examples. While you mention Luke’s various experiences, like crossing oceans and learning to shoot, these ideas often feel jumbled together rather than forming a coherent narrative. Try to break down your thoughts into clearer sections—perhaps start with his journey to the war, then discuss his training, and finally his experiences in combat. This will help your reader follow along more easily and appreciate the separate parts of his story.

When it comes to your writing ability, I see that you have a strong interest in the topic, and that passion can be a powerful tool in your writing. However, the way you express those ideas needs to become more refined. One of your biggest strengths is your ability to create vivid imagery—your descriptions of Luke’s experiences are engaging. On the flip side, you struggle with grammar and punctuation, which can confuse your readers. To develop your writing skills, I suggest practicing sentence structure and working on your spelling. Reading more historical narratives or essays might also help you see how other writers organize their thoughts.

To enhance your essay, focus on a few key areas. Start by outlining your main points before you write. This way, you can ensure that each idea flows logically into the next. Make sure to proofread your work for spelling and grammar errors—tools like spell check can be a big help. Finally, consider adding more details and examples to support your claims. For instance, when you mention that Luke had to feed himself and drink water, you could elaborate on how that affected his experience. 

Keep pushing yourself, and remember that every writer has room to grow! "

One thing that stands out is your enthusiasm for the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode Waves."" You really capture Luke's journey from uncertainty to joy, which makes the reading engaging. I can tell you have a genuine interest in the topic, and that adds a nice touch to the essay. 

However, there are areas where you can improve. The structure feels a bit disorganized, and some sentences could be clearer. For example, it would help to use more varied sentence structures to keep your writing lively. Also, be mindful of spelling and grammar. Words like ""definetally"" and ""excursion"" need some attention. Proofreading your work before submitting it can catch these little mistakes. 

In terms of your argument and examples, you do a good job of illustrating Luke's experiences and feelings about surfing and seeing animals. Yet, the essay would benefit from a more in-depth exploration of why some people disliked the trip. A few more details about their perspectives could strengthen your overall argument. 

Your writing style shows that you have a good grasp of storytelling, but you can further develop your writing competency by focusing on clarity. Try to use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the scenes you're describing. Additionally, incorporating dialogue or more specific examples from the story can enhance your narrative. 

Since you seem quite interested in the subject matter, I suggest taking time to brainstorm before writing. This way, you can map out your ideas and ensure a smoother flow. Also, practice varying your sentence structures and expanding on your points. This will make your writing richer and more engaging. Overall, keep up the enthusiasm for your topics, and don’t hesitate to dig deeper into the details!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out is your enthusiasm for the topic of seagoing and the way you express how it has impacted your life. It’s clear you have a personal connection to this experience, which makes your writing more engaging. However, the overall clarity of your essay is lacking, making it difficult for readers to fully understand your points.

One of the strengths of your essay is the vivid examples you provide about life at sea, like playing games during trips and caring for animals. These details help paint a picture of what being a seagoing entails. However, there are several areas for improvement. Your essay would benefit from clearer organization; right now, it feels a bit jumbled. Try to structure your paragraphs around specific ideas and ensure that each one flows logically to the next. Additionally, watch out for spelling and grammar mistakes—errors like ""borad"" instead of ""board"" and ""toked"" instead of ""took"" can distract readers from your message.

While you do present some interesting points about the challenges and joys of seagoing, your argument could be stronger. You mention dangers like broken ribs and the hard work involved, but these ideas feel a bit scattered. Instead, consider focusing on one or two key messages about why someone should become a seagoing. Use more examples to back up these points, perhaps elaborating on the life lessons or skills you've gained from your experiences.

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you have a good foundation, especially since you are interested in the topic. Your natural voice comes through, which is fantastic! However, there are some weaknesses in sentence structure and word choice that need attention. For instance, ""he's ribs broken"" should be ""his ribs were broken,"" and phrases like ""life time opportunity"" should be ""lifetime opportunity."" 

To develop further, I recommend focusing on proofreading your work for grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch awkward phrasing or unclear sentences. Additionally, try to create an outline before you start writing, so you have a clearer structure to follow. This will help you keep your thoughts organized and make your argument more compelling.

Overall, you have a solid base to build on, and with some revisions, I believe you can improve your essay significantly. Keep writing, and don’t hesitate to seek feedback in the future!"

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the topic of Venus, and it’s clear that you have a genuine interest in space exploration. You did a good job of summarizing the author's points and highlighting both the positive and negative aspects of pursuing Venus as a target for exploration. It’s great to see you engaging with the text and expressing your thoughts about it.

However, there are some areas where your writing could benefit from improvement. While you touched on various points, the organization of your essay could be clearer. For instance, some sentences feel a bit repetitive or lack the clarity needed to convey your ideas effectively. Strengthening your sentence structure and using more varied vocabulary could really enhance your writing. Additionally, be mindful of grammar and spelling—simple errors like ""explaning"" instead of ""explaining"" can distract from your message. 

When it comes to evaluating your argument and use of examples, you did well in mentioning specific examples, such as Venus being referred to as Earth's ""twin"" and mentioning NASA’s involvement. However, it would strengthen your essay to delve a bit deeper into these examples. Explain why these points matter in the context of your discussion—what implications do they have for the broader conversation about space exploration? This would add depth to your argument and demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the topic.

Your writing competency shows potential, but there are definitely some areas for growth. Your style is conversational and engaging, which is a strength, but working on clarity and coherence will help convey your ideas more effectively. One weakness is the tendency to use informal language and structure that may not fit the academic tone required for essays, so focusing on refining that aspect could be beneficial.

Given your interest in the subject, I recommend diving deeper into your analysis. Consider doing a bit more research to back up your claims and provide more detailed examples. Think about the structure of your essay as well—perhaps outline your main points before writing to ensure that each paragraph flows logically into the next. This way, your argument will come across more clearly. Lastly, take time to proofread your work to catch any small errors before submitting. 

Overall, you have a solid foundation here, and with a bit more attention to detail and structure, your essays can become even more impactful. Keep up the great work and continue exploring your interest in space!"

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowboys program and the impact it has had on Luke Bomberger. It’s clear that you’re passionate about helping others and the connections that can form through such programs. This enthusiasm is contagious and makes the reader want to learn more about your subject.

On the other hand, there are a few areas where the essay could be improved. For starters, some sentences feel a bit rushed or unclear. For example, when you mention Luke convincing people about his experience, it might be helpful to clarify what he’s convincing them of. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors and typos, like “a alot of people” and “convensing,” which can distract from your message. Taking a little extra time to proofread would really enhance your writing.

Your argument about the benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy is a solid one. You touch on how it helps both individuals and the larger community, which is a great point. However, it could be stronger if you included specific examples or stories from Luke’s experiences. These details could illustrate your points more vividly and make your argument more convincing. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a good foundation, but clarity and organization could use some work. While you express your ideas with enthusiasm, some sentences are a bit disjointed. It might help to outline your main points before you start writing to ensure everything flows well together. 

Strengths in your writing include your genuine passion for the topic and the way you convey the positive aspects of the Seagoing Cowboys program. However, you could benefit from focusing on sentence structure and grammar. 

I recommend taking the time to revise your essay. Consider breaking down your ideas into clearer sections. Adding specific examples from Luke’s experience could strengthen your argument and provide a more compelling narrative. Lastly, don’t forget to proofread for spelling and grammar. This will not only improve the clarity of your writing but also make your message stand out even more. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how your writing develops!"

What stands out immediately is your engaging introduction, where you set the stage for Luke's dilemma about going on a trip. It creates curiosity, and I appreciate how you encourage the reader to continue to find out more about his situation. However, the essay could benefit from clearer structure and more developed ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you present both sides of the argument — the reasons why Luke should and shouldn’t go on the trip. This shows that you’re thinking critically about the topic. However, the reasons on both sides feel somewhat underdeveloped. For example, while you mention that Luke could explore and learn, adding specific examples of what he might discover would strengthen your argument. Similarly, the dangers you mention, like the ship crashing or running out of food, could use more detail to explain why those are significant concerns.

In terms of writing ability, you have a good start with your ideas, but you need to pay more attention to grammar and sentence structure. There are several spelling errors, like “did't,” “existed,” “aslo,” and “enviorment,” which can distract the reader from your message. Additionally, some sentences are a bit choppy and could flow better with more varied sentence structures. For instance, instead of repeating ""he should go,"" you might try rephrasing it to make the writing more dynamic.

To develop your writing further, I encourage you to work on organizing your thoughts more clearly. Consider making an outline before you start writing to help structure your arguments. This could help you expand on your points and provide more detailed examples. Also, take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammar mistakes. Reading your essay aloud can help catch errors and improve flow.

Overall, you have the foundation of a solid argument, but with more depth, clarity, and attention to detail, your writing can become much more persuasive and engaging. Keep at it!"

What stands out immediately is your engagement with a historical context and a personal narrative that could resonate with readers. The story of Luke and his adventure on the cattle boat has the potential to be compelling, especially given the backdrop of post-World War II efforts. However, the overall execution needs significant improvement in clarity and structure.

One of the strengths of your essay is the inclusion of personal experience, which adds a layer of authenticity to your writing. You’ve touched on important themes such as friendship, adventure, and humanitarian efforts, which are relatable and can engage readers. However, there are several areas where you could enhance your writing. For instance, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. Words like ""freind,"" ""devistated,"" and ""loses"" need correction. Additionally, the essay's flow is choppy, with some sentences feeling incomplete or poorly structured. Working on sentence construction and coherence will greatly improve the overall readability.

Your argument about the importance of helping devastated countries is a strong foundation for your essay. However, it could benefit from deeper exploration. You mentioned the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), which is a significant detail, but it feels somewhat tacked on rather than integrated into your narrative. Try to weave in more context or examples of how this organization made a difference, perhaps by sharing specific stories or statistics. That would help to reinforce your argument and give readers a clearer picture of the impact of the work Luke was involved in.

In terms of writing competency and style, you are showing a willingness to tackle an important topic, which is commendable. However, the numerous grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasing hinder your message. For example, phrases like ""the get to play volleyball"" are confusing and need rephrasing. Your narrative can benefit from more varied sentence structures to add rhythm and interest to your writing. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on your vocabulary and grammar.

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the topic of Seagoing Cowgirls. It’s clear that you have a personal connection to this subject, which can make your writing more engaging. However, the overall structure and clarity of your essay need significant improvement to effectively communicate your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the Seagoing Cowgirls and how you relate it to Luke's aspirations. You clearly care about the character and what she wants, which is a great start. However, the essay suffers from a lack of organization and clarity. Many sentences are repetitive and some contain spelling and grammatical errors that make it difficult to follow your argument. For example, phrases like ""she might enjoy going"" and ""might help her with something"" are vague and don’t provide strong support. It would help to focus on specific examples that illustrate why this program is beneficial for Luke.

When it comes to your argument, I see the potential for a strong case about why Luke should join the program. However, you need to provide concrete examples or details from the article that support your claims. Instead of saying “Luke is a good person,” try to show how her characteristics and interests make her a great fit for the program. This could involve describing her actions, thoughts, or experiences that demonstrate her commitment to becoming a Seagoing Cowgirl.

As a writer, you have the foundation of strong passion, but your writing style needs more refinement. Sometimes the ideas feel jumbled, and spelling mistakes, like ""actullay"" and ""dissions,"" detract from your credibility. Focusing on sentence structure and grammar will greatly enhance your clarity. Try reading your essay out loud to catch awkward phrases or errors. It might also help to organize your thoughts into an outline before you start writing, so your ideas flow logically from one to the next.

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic, consider diving deeper into why Luke’s journey matters. How does her experience reflect broader themes or challenges? This could provide more depth to your argument and make your essay more compelling. 

In summary, I encourage you to harness your passion for the topic and put more effort into organizing and clarifying your thoughts. With practice and attention to detail, you can create a more persuasive and polished essay. Keep writing, and don’t hesitate to ask for help with revisions!"
M-F2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowgirl.This is why in paragraph 2 she said when she went over seas world war ll was begining, if she was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat she was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean.

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the topic of being a sea-going cowgirl during World War II. It’s clear you have an interest in the challenges faced by individuals in that era, which is a great starting point. However, while your passion shines through, the essay lacks clarity and organization, making it difficult for the reader to follow your main points.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you provide specific examples from the story, like the incidents of the hourly roll call and the injury involving the metal pole. These details add a personal touch to your argument. However, there are several areas for improvement. For instance, your writing has some grammatical errors, such as ""acording"" instead of ""according"" and ""do her job any more"" which should be ""do her job anymore."" These mistakes can distract from your message. Additionally, the structure of your essay could be more cohesive. You jump between ideas rather abruptly, so working on transitions between your thoughts would help make your argument more fluid.

When it comes to your argument about why Luke should not be a sea-going cowgirl, you touch on important points like the risk of injury and seasickness. However, you could strengthen your argument by exploring these ideas more deeply. Rather than just stating the risks, consider discussing the implications of those risks and how they impact a person's willingness or ability to pursue that career. This would add depth to your argument and make it more convincing.

In terms of your writing ability, you show a good understanding of the topic, but your style could benefit from more clarity and polish. The enthusiasm is great, but it’s important to ensure that your ideas are communicated clearly. One of your weaknesses is the use of punctuation and sentence structure; sometimes, your sentences feel long and run-on, making them hard to read. 

To develop your writing further, focus on organizing your ideas before you start writing. You might want to outline the main points you want to make and think about how you can connect them logically. Additionally, take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch awkward phrases or mistakes. Lastly, consider exploring your examples more thoroughly—perhaps including more context or analysis for each situation you describe.

Overall, your enthusiasm for the topic is a great asset, but honing your writing skills will help convey your ideas more effectively in the future. Keep working at it!"

","This essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowgirls program and your desire for Luke to return. It’s clear that you’re interested in the topic and have some personal thoughts on the experience. I appreciate the way you conveyed Luke's passion for her job and her connection to the animals and the sea. 

However, there are several areas where the essay could improve. First, the organization of your ideas feels a bit scattered. It’s hard to follow your thoughts because there are quite a few run-on sentences and some grammatical errors. Breaking your ideas into clearer sentences and paragraphs would help your reader understand your main points better. Also, spelling mistakes like “craked” instead of “cracked” and “progarm” instead of “program” can distract from your message, so paying closer attention to proofreading would make a big difference.

Your argument about why Luke should return to the program is interesting, but it would be stronger if you elaborated a bit more on specific experiences or feelings. For example, sharing a particular story about what she enjoyed while in the program could really paint a picture for your readers. Additionally, discussing her injuries and how they impact her goals could add depth to your argument and show a more complex view of her situation.

In terms of writing competency, you show a lot of passion, but your style needs some refinement. Your ideas are there, but they get lost in the structure. Focusing on sentence clarity and grammar will help you communicate your thoughts more effectively. 

To enhance your essay, try outlining your main points before writing. This can help you stay organized and create a logical flow. Also, consider using smaller sentences or breaking up long ones to improve readability. Lastly, don’t forget to proofread for spelling and grammar mistakes; maybe read it out loud to catch things you might overlook. 

Overall, your interest in the Seagoing Cowgirls program shines through, and with a bit of effort on structure and clarity, your writing can become even more engaging!"

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the topic and the idea of pursuing a job that brings joy and adventure. It's clear you're passionate about the subject, which is a great starting point for any writing. However, the essay lacks clarity and organization, making it a bit difficult to follow your main ideas.

One of the strengths of your writing is the genuine excitement you express for the job you're discussing. You emphasize the enjoyment of traveling and the freedom that comes with it, which is relatable. However, the essay would benefit from clearer structure. Right now, thoughts seem to jump around a lot, and there are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. For example, words like ""horses"" and ""because"" are misspelled, and phrases like ""you could go acrossed the ocean"" could be more fluid. Taking time to proofread your work can really help polish your ideas.

When it comes to the argument and examples you've used, I see the potential for a strong case about why people should pursue this job. However, your argument comes off as repetitive, as you mention similar points multiple times without adding new details. Try to provide specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate the joys and challenges of the job. This will not only make your argument stronger but also engage your readers more effectively.

Your writing ability shows that you have the basics down, but there’s room for growth in your style and clarity. I appreciate your conversational tone, which makes your writing feel personal and relatable. But, focusing on sentence structure and coherence will help convey your ideas more effectively. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend reading more essays or articles on topics you’re interested in. Pay attention to how they organize their thoughts and present their arguments. Additionally, practice writing outlines before jumping into the essay. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that each paragraph flows into the next. Lastly, don’t hesitate to ask for feedback on your drafts before finalizing them; this can provide you with valuable insights.

By putting in a little more effort to refine your ideas and pay attention to language mechanics, you can create a much stronger essay that truly reflects your passion for the subject. Keep writing and exploring your thoughts!"

What stands out is your enthusiasm for the topic of being a seagoing cowgirl. It's clear you find this idea exciting and want to share that excitement with others. You highlight some interesting points about the adventures and experiences that come with the job, which is great for drawing in your readers.

 

However, there are a few areas where you could improve. Your essay would benefit from clearer organization. Right now, the ideas feel a bit jumbled, making it hard to follow your main points. Consider using topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide your reader through your thoughts. Also, watch out for spelling and grammar mistakes, like ""havig"" instead of ""having"" and ""greece"" which should be capitalized as ""Greece."" These small errors can distract from your message.

 

In terms of your argument, you have some solid examples from the passage, but they could be developed further. For instance, when you mention the record Luke holds, you could explain why that’s significant and how it relates to the overall message of inspiring young girls. Adding a bit more detail or personal reflection would strengthen your argument and give your readers a clearer picture of what you want to convey.

 

Looking at your writing ability, I see that you have a good grasp of the main ideas, but clarity is key. Your style shows enthusiasm, which is a strength, but the execution can be improved to enhance communication. Take the time to proofread your work before submitting. This will help you catch those little mistakes and refine your ideas.

 

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic of seagoing cowgirls, use that passion to dive deeper into the experiences you want to share. Try to include more specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate your points. For instance, you could describe what it was like for the character to visit China or Greece in a more vivid way. Additionally, consider structuring your essay with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion to help your readers follow along better. With some focused revisions and attention to detail, I believe you can elevate your essay significantly!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a score of 2 out of 5.

What stands out is your enthusiasm for the topic of seagoing cowgirls and the adventurous spirit of Luke Bomberger. You clearly have an interest in this subject, which makes for a great starting point. It’s always exciting to read about personal stories that reflect unique experiences, and you’ve chosen an interesting character to focus on.

However, there are several areas that need significant improvement. First, your essay has many grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing that can make it difficult for the reader to follow your ideas. It’s important to proofread your work before submitting it to catch those little mistakes. For example, ""grocrey"" should be ""grocery,"" and there are some run-on sentences that could be broken up for clarity. Also, consider using more precise vocabulary; some phrases, like ""opportunity of a life time,"" could be expressed more fluidly.

In terms of your argument and examples, you have a solid starting point, but they need more development. You mention fun activities and challenges, which is great, but you could expand on these experiences to show how they shaped Luke as a person. Instead of just listing activities like ""Baseball"" and ""Fencing,"" try explaining how these experiences contributed to her growth or character. This will help your readers connect more deeply with the story you’re telling.

Looking at your writing style, it’s clear you have a passion for storytelling, and that’s a strength. However, the overall structure of your essay feels a bit disorganized. It would help to outline your thoughts before writing; this way, you can create a flow that guides the reader through your narrative. Also, try to work on varying your sentence structure to improve readability and keep your audience engaged.

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on a few key areas. First, take time to revise and edit your work for grammar and clarity. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch errors and awkward phrasing. Secondly, when you’re presenting ideas or examples, spend a little more time elaborating on them; this will enrich your essay significantly. Lastly, consider exploring different writing resources or even writing workshops that focus on narrative structure and style. 

Overall, you have a compelling topic and a strong voice. With some effort in organization and editing, you can turn this into a much more polished piece. Keep writing and refining your skills—you’re on the right track!"
M-F7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. If you read the passege, Luke says her life was changed and she had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities she visted. Some of things she visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things she did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things she did on board. She had to get water for the horses and feed them. She also had to be a nightwatch women.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowgirls is not a bad idea. She says that it changed her life and she got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because she did the program her decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your clear enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowgirls program. It’s great to see you engaged with the topic and sharing your thoughts on how it can change lives. The mention of specific experiences, like visiting Venice and the Panama Canal, adds a personal touch that makes your argument relatable.

However, there are several areas where you could improve. First, watch out for spelling and grammatical errors—words like ""exsperences"" and ""abourd"" can distract your reader. Also, some sentences could be clearer. For instance, breaking down your ideas into more structured paragraphs could help guide your reader through your argument more effectively. 

When it comes to your argument, you did a good job referencing Luke’s experiences, but it would strengthen your position if you included more details or examples from the text. Try to elaborate on why those experiences matter. For instance, how did they inspire others, or what specific skills did Luke gain that could be beneficial for someone considering the program? The more you can connect those dots, the more compelling your argument will be.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a good understanding of the topic, but your writing could benefit from more clarity and coherence. Your ideas are there, but they sometimes feel jumbled together. Focusing on sentence structure and word choice will help your writing flow more smoothly. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend reading it out loud to catch any awkward phrases or errors. Also, consider adding a concluding paragraph that summarizes your main points and reinforces your argument. This will help wrap up your essay nicely and give your reader a clear takeaway. Lastly, if you're interested in the topic, perhaps include a personal reflection on what inspired you to write about the Seagoing Cowgirls—this could make your essay even more engaging! Keep pushing yourself; you definitely have the potential to create a strong piece!"
M-F8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what she thinks about what she is doing,what she thinks about her friends, and what she thinks of helping others. But I bet she would think nice things about helping people because she saide that she liked the job. And when her friend asked her if she wanted to go with her she said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it she didnt want to miss. She also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and she also liked the journey geting to Europe with her friend. Plus we would of know what she thought about the journey,the place she was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what she thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what she thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how she felt when she craked her ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that she had with her new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what she felt and thought of it. Did she like it or not. And how about her family we would of know what she thought of them. Of course she would say good things about them but still we would of know more about her thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to her because it opened her world and changed her life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what she has now.","

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the topic and your desire to explore how the story would change if told in the first person. You clearly have a vision for what this perspective could reveal about Luke’s thoughts and feelings, and that’s a great starting point. 

However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization and more careful proofreading. There are several spelling errors, like ""saide"" instead of ""said,"" ""geting"" instead of ""getting,"" and ""Acording"" instead of ""According."" These distract from your ideas and can make your writing harder to follow. Additionally, your points sometimes feel repetitive; you mention wanting to know Luke's thoughts on multiple occasions without adding new information. Focusing on fewer, stronger examples would help solidify your argument.

Your argument about how a first-person perspective would give insight into Luke's experiences is interesting, but it would be even stronger with specific examples from the text that support your claims. For instance, when you mention her thoughts on Italy or the adventure with her friends, try to tie these observations back to moments in the story. This would not only illustrate your points but also show a deeper engagement with the source material.

In terms of writing competency, it’s clear you have a genuine interest in the topic. However, you’ll want to work on structuring your essays more clearly. Think about starting with an introduction that lays out your main argument, followed by body paragraphs that each tackle a specific point, and then a conclusion that wraps everything up. 

To develop your writing skills, I recommend taking the time to draft an outline before you begin writing. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your essay remains focused. Also, practice proofreading your work or reading it out loud to catch errors and awkward phrasing. 

Overall, I can see you have a passion for the subject, which is fantastic! Keep working on refining your writing, and don’t hesitate to share more of your ideas. You’ve got a good foundation here; let’s build on it!"

Your writing has a sense of adventure and creativity, which is great to see when writing about such a historical topic. You bring a unique character, Luke Bomberger, to life, and it’s clear you’re passionate about the subject matter, especially since you seem to have a strong interest in World War II. 

However, the essay has several areas that need improvement, particularly in clarity and organization. Some sentences are difficult to follow, and there are frequent spelling and grammatical errors that can distract the reader from your story. For example, names like “august” and “atlantic” need capitalization, and phrases like “discharded” and “prafict” should be corrected as “discharged” and “Pacific.” 

You have some strengths in creating a personal narrative that captures the reader's attention. Your use of dialogue helps bring Luke’s experiences to life, and the emotional connection with her family is a nice touch. However, the essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider organizing your thoughts into paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of her journey. This would make it easier for readers to follow along with Luke's experiences and thoughts.

When it comes to your argument, there's a compelling story here, but it feels scattered. You mention Luke’s training, her trips, and her feelings, but these points need to be more connected. For instance, elaborating on how her experiences affected her views on war would add depth. Also, some of the details, like the mention of sending postcards, could be expanded to show how those communications impacted her family and her morale.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show promise in your storytelling abilities, but you need to work on sentence structure and coherence. The flow of your narrative often gets interrupted due to awkward phrasing, and this can make it hard for readers to stay engaged. A good approach would be to read your work out loud to catch any awkward sentences or confusion.

To improve, I recommend focusing on a few key areas. First, practice writing shorter, clearer sentences. This will help ensure your ideas come across more effectively. Second, try to outline your essay before writing. This way, you can organize your thoughts and make sure each paragraph has a clear purpose. Lastly, consider going back to proofread your work for spelling and grammar errors. Tools like spell check can be helpful, but don’t rely solely on them; reading your work with fresh eyes can often catch mistakes you might miss.

Overall, you’ve got a fascinating story and a unique voice, but refining your writing skills will make your essays even stronger. Keep working on it!"

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the story ""A Cowgirl Who Rode Waves."" It's clear that you really connected with Luke's journey and her experiences, which is fantastic. Your excitement for the subject matter shines through, making it engaging for readers who might share that interest.

One of the strengths of your writing is the way you capture Luke's feelings and determination. You effectively convey her initial excitement and growing confidence as she tries surfing, which helps the reader understand her character arc. However, there are several areas where you can improve. For example, some sentences run together, making it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts. Consider breaking your ideas into shorter sentences and using proper punctuation to enhance clarity. Additionally, make sure to check spelling—words like ""definitely,"" ""experience,"" and ""friend"" need a little attention.

In terms of argument and examples, while you did mention that some people didn’t enjoy the trip, it would strengthen your essay if you explored that idea further. Why do you think some people felt that way? Adding a bit more depth to Luke's perspective on those differing opinions could provide a richer understanding of the experience. 

As for your writing ability, you show great potential and a casual style that makes your work relatable, especially for a younger audience. However, you should focus on improving your sentence structure and grammar. A clearer organization of your thoughts will really help your essay stand out. 

To help you develop further, I suggest reading more essays or stories that interest you, paying attention to how they flow. You might also practice writing short paragraphs and focusing on one idea at a time before expanding. This can help you build a stronger foundation for your writing. Lastly, don't hesitate to ask for feedback from peers or teachers before submitting your work—sometimes a fresh pair of eyes can catch things we might miss.

Overall, keep writing and exploring topics you love. You're on the right track!"

","This essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5. 

Your enthusiasm for the topic really shines through! It’s clear that you have a personal connection to being a seagoing, which adds a lot of character to your writing. I appreciate how you've shared your journey and experiences, making it feel relatable for the reader.

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you describe the adventures and activities on board. You paint a vivid picture of life at sea, and your anecdotes about playing games and working with animals help to create a lively atmosphere. However, there are several areas where you could improve. For instance, you have quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that make it difficult to follow your ideas. Words like “becouse,” “tolled,” and “toke” should be corrected to “because,” “told,” and “took.” Also, be mindful of punctuation; some sentences are run-ons, which can confuse readers. 

When evaluating your argument, it’s clear that you're trying to convince others to consider a life at sea. However, the flow of your argument could be strengthened. Right now, the essay jumps around a bit, and some points could be more clearly connected. For example, when you mention the dangers of the sea, it could be helpful to elaborate more on that aspect and how it contrasts with the fun experiences you had.

As for your writing competency and style, you have a good voice that could be even more effective with careful editing. The enthusiasm is there, but the clarity needs some work. Strengths include your vivid descriptions and personal anecdotes, but weaknesses lie in grammar, spelling, and structure. 

To improve, I recommend taking the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch mistakes and ensure your sentences flow better. Additionally, consider organizing your ideas more cohesively. It might help to outline your essay before writing, so you can see how each point connects to the next. This way, your argument can build more effectively.

Lastly, since you seem interested in the world of seagoing, you might want to dive deeper into specific experiences or facts that could make your argument even more compelling. For example, including a brief story about a specific adventure at sea could really capture your reader's attention. Keep writing and refining your skills — you have a great foundation to build upon!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your attempt to cover both sides of the argument regarding Venus, showcasing that you understand the complexity of the topic. You did a nice job mentioning how Venus can be seen as both appealing and dangerous, which is important for a well-rounded discussion.

However, there are a few areas where your writing could improve. For instance, there are multiple spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""explaning,"" ""puting,"" and ""maner."" Taking the time to proofread your work would help you catch these mistakes and make your arguments clearer. Additionally, while your points are solid, they could benefit from a bit more depth. For example, instead of just stating that NASA has ""one compelling idea,"" you could elaborate on what that idea is and why it matters. This would give your readers a clearer picture of your argument.

In terms of your argument's evaluation, it's clear that you have engaged with the material and have a good grasp of the subject. However, your examples feel a bit surface-level. For instance, when you mention that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" it would be helpful to explain why that comparison is made or what implications it has for exploration. Adding specific examples or data could strengthen your position.

Looking at your writing style, I see that you have a conversational tone, which makes it approachable. This is a strength, especially considering your interest in the topic of Venus. However, you might want to work on varying your sentence structure to enhance the flow of your writing. Some sentences are quite short and could be combined for better coherence. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on expanding your points with more detailed analysis and supporting examples. Practice proofreading your work to catch those little errors that can detract from your overall message. You might want to read your essay out loud; sometimes, hearing your writing can help you spot awkward phrasing or unclear ideas.

Overall, you have a strong foundation, and with a little more depth and polish, your essays could really shine! Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you incorporate this feedback into your next piece."

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowgirls program. You clearly believe in the positive impact it has on the community, and that passion comes through in your writing. It’s great to see you reflecting on how helping others can create connections and foster a sense of community. 

 

One of the strengths of your essay is the personal connection you make with the subject. You mention Luke Bomberger's experience, which adds a nice touch. However, there are areas where you could improve the clarity and flow of your writing. For instance, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, like ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and ""convensing"" instead of ""convincing."" These mistakes can distract the reader from your main points. Additionally, some sentences feel a bit repetitive. Try to vary your sentence structure to keep your reader more engaged.

 

When you discuss the impact of the Seagoing Cowgirls, you touch on important ideas, but your argument could be stronger with more specific examples. For instance, you mention that Luke has fun while helping others, but you don’t provide details about what activities she participates in or how those experiences shape her views. Including specific stories or examples would make your argument more compelling and relatable. 

 

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a good understanding of the topic and convey your thoughts clearly, but there are moments when the language feels a bit informal or imprecise. Your ideas are solid, but refining your grammar and vocabulary could elevate your writing. 

 

To enhance your essay, I recommend taking some time to edit for spelling and grammar. Consider reading your work out loud, as this can help you catch awkward phrasing or repetitive ideas. Additionally, think about adding a few more details or anecdotes about the Seagoing Cowgirls program to strengthen your argument. If you can share specific activities or outcomes, it will help paint a clearer picture for your readers. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how your writing develops!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5. 

What stands out is your clear enthusiasm for the topic and your desire to explore the reasons behind Luke's decision about the trip. It’s great that you’ve started with a relatable question, engaging the reader right from the start. You’ve also made an effort to outline both the pros and cons of the trip, which is a solid way to structure your argument. 

However, there are several areas where you could improve. For one, be careful with spelling and grammar. Mistakes like “did't” instead of “didn’t” and “aslo” instead of “also” can distract readers from your main points. Additionally, your essay would benefit from smoother transitions between your ideas. Right now, some points feel a bit choppy, and adding connecting phrases could help your writing flow better. 

When it comes to your argument, while you mention both good and bad reasons, the bad reasons seem a bit vague. Consider providing a bit more detail or context. For example, you could explain why the ship crashing is a significant concern or explore how getting stranded might affect their adventure. This would add depth to your argument and make it more convincing. 

Your writing shows that you are interested in the topic, and this passion is a strength! However, focusing on clarity and detail will help you communicate your ideas more effectively. A few specific suggestions: take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammar errors, and try to expand on your points with examples or explanations to really strengthen your argument. Perhaps you could think about what Luke might learn from the trip or how her friendship could grow through this experience.

","Your essay shows promise and earns a score of 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your enthusiasm for the topic, which clearly reflects your interest in the post-World War II era and the efforts to help devastated countries. You have a compelling story about your character's experience on a cattle boat, and that narrative has the potential to be engaging and informative. 

However, there are several areas where you can improve. First, the organization of your essay needs work. Right now, the ideas feel a bit jumbled, making it hard to follow the main points you're trying to convey. Breaking the essay into clearer sections—like an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion—would help guide your reader through your thoughts. Additionally, watch out for grammar and spelling errors, as they distract from your message. For instance, ""freind"" should be ""friend,"" and ""loses"" should be ""lost."" These small mistakes can impact the overall professionalism of your writing. 

Regarding your argument and use of examples, while you mention the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, you don't really explain its significance. It would strengthen your essay to include a bit more context about why this organization was formed and how it relates to your character's journey. Adding details about specific experiences or challenges faced during the mission could also make your story more vivid and relatable. 

In terms of your writing style, you show a lot of potential. Your voice comes through, which is great! However, the flow of your sentences sometimes falls flat, with abrupt transitions that can confuse the reader. Try to vary your sentence structure a bit more and connect your ideas with transitional phrases. This will help your essay feel more cohesive. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend practicing proofreading your work for spelling and grammar mistakes. You might also consider outlining your essays before you start writing. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your argument is clear. Lastly, reading other essays on similar topics can inspire you and give you a sense of how to structure your own writing effectively. 

With a bit of extra effort and attention to detail, I believe you can transform this essay into something truly compelling. Keep working at it!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa's expression. You’ve clearly engaged with the artwork and tried to convey the complexity of her smile, which is a great starting point. I appreciate how you interpreted her expression as a mix of happiness and indifference, and that you noticed the surrounding environment adds depth to your analysis.

However, there are several areas where the essay could improve significantly. For one, the organization of your thoughts is a bit unclear and could benefit from a more structured approach. Sentences often run on without clear connections, making it difficult for the reader to follow your train of thought. Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall quality of your writing. For instance, ""frew"" should be ""felt,"" and ""donest"" should be ""doesn't."" Taking time to proofread your work can make a substantial difference.

Your argument about the painting's colors and their emotional implications is interesting, but it could use more depth. You mention that the colors are muted and that it reflects her feelings, yet you don't fully explain how or why this is significant. Integrating specific examples or comparisons to other artworks could strengthen your argument and make your points more compelling. 

Considering your interest in the topic, it would be beneficial to dive deeper into the historical context of the painting and Da Vinci’s intentions. This could add another layer to your analysis and make your essay more informative. 

In terms of writing style, it's clear you have a voice, but the execution needs some work. Focus on clarity and coherence. Shorter sentences can help convey your ideas more effectively. Don't hesitate to break down complex ideas into simpler parts, making it easier for your reader to grasp your points. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend revising for clarity and structure. Outline your main points before writing to ensure each idea flows logically into the next. Also, consider reading your essay out loud to catch awkward phrases or unclear sentences. This can help you refine your writing and ensure that your unique insights shine through. Lastly, don’t shy away from seeking feedback from peers or using writing resources to polish your work further. Keep at it!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa and the concept of using technology to alter her expression. It’s clear that you’re interested in the intersection of art and technology, which is a fascinating topic that many people can relate to. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization and more attention to detail in your writing.

One of the strengths of your essay is the creative idea of a computer program giving the Mona Lisa a smile. This thought-provoking angle could really engage readers if it were developed further. However, there are several areas where you could improve. For instance, the use of grammar and spelling needs significant attention. Words like ""best,"" ""camra,"" ""softwear,"" and ""inportant"" detract from the clarity of your message. Additionally, the logical flow of your ideas is a bit hard to follow. It would help to set up a clearer structure with distinct paragraphs for each major idea.

Your argument about the importance of emotion in art is interesting, but it feels a bit underdeveloped. While you mention Thomas Huang and the technology he created, providing more context or examples would strengthen your points. It would be beneficial to explain why the Mona Lisa’s expression matters in the art world and how changing it alters the viewer's experience. The statistics you included about her emotions were a good touch, but they could be better integrated into your overall argument.

In terms of writing competency and style, you have the foundation of good ideas, but your execution needs refinement. You demonstrate an understanding of the topic, but the delivery falls short. Your writing has a conversational tone, which can be engaging, but it sometimes leads to run-on sentences and confusion. 

To improve, I recommend focusing on your grammar and spelling. Consider revising your essay to break up your ideas into clearer sections. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea, starting with a topic sentence that sets the stage for what you’ll discuss. Additionally, try to include more examples and details to support your arguments. 

Given your clear interest in the topic, I encourage you to continue exploring the relationship between art and technology. Perhaps research more about how technology is used in art today and incorporate those insights into your writing. This will not only help clarify your points but also make your essay more engaging for readers. Keep writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback as you develop your skills!"
F3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa's expression and your willingness to challenge popular interpretations. It's great to see you questioning established ideas and forming your own opinions. The topic is intriguing, and your voice feels genuine, which is an important aspect of engaging writing.

However, the essay does have some significant issues that need attention. The organization feels a bit scattered, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument clearly. There are several grammatical and spelling errors—like ""expiriencing,"" ""dissapointed,"" and ""noticable""—that detract from your message. It could help to break your thoughts into clearer sections with transitions that guide the reader through your argument more smoothly. 

Your argument is interesting but lacks depth and clarity. While you touch on the idea that emotions are complex and not easily read from facial expressions, it would strengthen your essay to support your claims with more evidence or examples. For instance, discussing similar artworks or referencing studies on facial expressions might enhance your argument. This would not only bolster your point but also demonstrate a broader understanding of the topic.

As for your writing ability, it's clear you have a strong interest in art and emotion, which is a fantastic starting point. Your passion comes through, but your writing style needs refinement. Strengths include your engaging voice and original thoughts; weaknesses include grammatical errors and lack of clarity in your argument. 

To develop your skills, consider focusing on structuring your essays more clearly. Try outlining your main points before writing to ensure a logical flow. Additionally, practice proofreading your work or using tools that can help catch spelling and grammar mistakes. Reading more essays or articles on similar topics can also inspire you and provide examples of effective argumentation and writing style.

Overall, I encourage you to keep exploring this topic. Your interest can be the fuel for deeper analysis and stronger writing. With some revisions and more careful attention to detail, you can really elevate your essays to the next level!"

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Facial Coding System and its limitations. You raise an important point about the necessity of personal communication when it comes to understanding emotions. Your focus on the Mona Lisa adds an interesting touch, as it connects historical art to contemporary technology, which many readers can appreciate. 

However, there are several areas where you could improve. The essay tends to be repetitive, with the same ideas being restated without much development. This can make your argument feel a bit circular rather than progressing toward a clear conclusion. Additionally, the writing could benefit from clearer organization. Creating distinct paragraphs for your introduction, body, and conclusion would help the reader follow your ideas more easily.

In terms of your argument, while you present a strong opinion against the Facial Coding System, it would be more convincing with additional examples or research. For instance, citing studies or expert opinions about emotional expression could strengthen your stance. Right now, your argument feels a bit one-dimensional, focusing mainly on the limitations without exploring any counterarguments or evidence that might exist in favor of the technology.

Looking at your writing style, you showcase a conversational tone, which is engaging. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that detract from your overall message. Issues like run-on sentences and misspellings—like ""perent"" instead of ""percent""—can confuse readers and distract from your argument. It’s essential to proofread your work carefully to catch these mistakes before submitting. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend outlining your ideas before you start writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure each point is clear and well-supported. Also, consider expanding your research on the Facial Coding System and incorporating a few more examples to provide a broader context for your argument. Finally, take the time to edit your writing for clarity and correctness, which will make your strong opinions shine even brighter. Keep pushing your ideas, and with some revision, you can create a compelling essay!"

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5.

What stands out is your clear understanding of the topic and your ability to summarize the author’s arguments effectively. You’ve clearly engaged with the material, demonstrating an interest in the exploration of Venus that comes through in your writing. The structure of your essay is straightforward, which makes it easy to follow.

One of your strengths is how you identified the challenges presented by Venus and the solutions proposed by the author. You did a nice job referencing specific paragraphs and details, which helps ground your arguments. However, there are areas you could improve. For example, while you summarize well, your analysis sometimes lacks depth. Instead of just stating that the author provides solutions, you could delve a little deeper into how effective those solutions might be or why they matter in the broader context of space exploration.

In terms of argument evaluation, you effectively highlight the points made by the author. However, your essay could be strengthened by providing your own perspective or critique. What do you think about the solutions? Do you believe they’re realistic or feasible? Adding your voice to the discussion would enrich your analysis and make it more engaging for the reader.

Your writing style is generally clear, but there are a few areas that need polishing. There were some minor typographical errors, like ""30 or so milles"" instead of ""miles,"" and phrases like ""ground counditions"" instead of ""ground conditions."" Proofreading your work for such errors can greatly enhance the professionalism of your writing. 

Since you seem interested in the topic, I encourage you to dig a little deeper into the implications of studying Venus. Explore what it could mean for our understanding of planetary science or how it relates to Earth’s future. This could provide a more robust foundation for your arguments. 

Overall, you have a solid base to work with, and with a bit more critical engagement and attention to detail, your essays could become even more compelling!"
F6,Making mona lisa smile agian was the main topic detail in the story. For one reason it would have to be when they painted a picture of her for acomplishing the process of the model of a great model she smiled for that picture. So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one.

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your attempt to engage with the topic of the Mona Lisa and her expression. You have a clear interest in the subject, which is great because it can make your writing more engaging. However, the organization and clarity of your ideas need some work to really make your points shine.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you try to discuss specific details about the painting and how technology can alter perceptions of it. This shows that you're thinking critically about the art piece. However, there are several areas for improvement. The overall structure of your essay feels a bit jumbled. It jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, which can confuse your readers. Additionally, some sentences are a bit unclear or awkwardly phrased. For example, phrases like ""a little bit better than the original one"" could be more precise and confidently stated.

When it comes to your argument, it seems like you have a foundation of ideas about how the computer model improves upon the original Mona Lisa. However, you need to support those claims with more detail and examples. For instance, explaining how the technology enhances specific elements of the painting or discussing the emotional impact in more depth could strengthen your argument. Make sure to clearly connect each point back to your main thesis about making Mona Lisa smile again.

In terms of writing competency and style, you've shown a good grasp of basic ideas, but there are some weaknesses in sentence structure and grammar. Some sentences are overly long or convoluted, making it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts. Try to break complex ideas into shorter, clearer sentences. Additionally, pay attention to spelling and grammar, as these small errors can detract from your overall message.

As someone interested in this topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into your analysis. To enhance your essay, consider outlining your main points before you start writing. This way, you can create a logical flow for your ideas. Also, don’t hesitate to include quotes or references to the painting to provide evidence for your claims. Lastly, proofread your work to catch any lingering grammatical mistakes and ensure your ideas are conveyed clearly. Keep practicing, and you’ll keep improving!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

Right off the bat, I can see you’re genuinely interested in the intersection of technology and emotional expression, especially with such a fascinating topic as the Mona Lisa. That enthusiasm is a great starting point, and it’s clear you’re trying to convey something meaningful about how technology can interpret emotions. However, the organization and clarity of your ideas need some work to really make your points shine. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the choice of example—using the Mona Lisa to illustrate the complexities of emotional detection is engaging and relatable. You also touch on the idea of technology being able to distinguish between real and fake smiles, which is a relevant and interesting angle. However, the areas that need improvement are quite significant. Firstly, the writing contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that disrupt the flow of your ideas. For instance, terms like “fro read” and “its something aswesome” could be polished for clarity. Additionally, some sentences are overly complex or unclear, which makes it hard to follow your main argument. It would help if you worked on sentence structure and clarity to enhance your points.

In terms of argument and examples, while you mention the use of the Mona Lisa and the computer’s ability to differentiate smiles, it would be beneficial to expand on this. What specific technology are you referring to? How does it work in practice? Adding more detail and perhaps a few more examples could help strengthen your argument and provide context for your reader. 

As for your writing ability, it shows a budding potential, but there are noticeable weaknesses in grammar, punctuation, and structure that could be improved. Your strengths lie in your choice of topic and your willingness to engage with complex ideas, but these strengths are somewhat overshadowed by the need for clearer expression. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend revising your sentences for clarity and coherence. Try breaking down complex ideas into simpler sentences and make sure each point logically follows the one before it. Also, consider reading your essay out loud; this can help you catch awkward phrases and improve the overall flow. Don’t hesitate to provide more details and examples in your arguments to make your points stronger. Lastly, revising your grammar and punctuation will greatly enhance the professionalism of your writing. 

Keep working on your ideas, and I’m excited to see how you can develop them further!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5.

It's clear that you have an intriguing idea and a creative scenario with your discovery of a mask on Mars. The way you set up the discussion between you and Christina adds an engaging element to your writing. I can see you're really interested in the topic of Mars and how people interpret what they see, which makes for a compelling read.

One of the strengths of your essay is the dialogue you included. It gives a little personality to the characters and helps convey their differing viewpoints. However, there are areas where you could improve. For instance, be careful with grammar and sentence structure; phrases like ""me and my partner"" should be ""my partner and I."" Also, watch for misspellings like ""Christna"" and ""obivious."" These small errors can distract readers from your ideas. Additionally, try to organize your thoughts more clearly. The flow of your ideas felt a bit choppy at times, which made it hard to follow your argument.

When it comes to your argument, you present an interesting debate between the natural formation of the mask and the idea of it being an alien artifact. However, it could be strengthened by providing more context or evidence for both sides. You mention NASA's findings, which is great, but exploring more details about that discovery could really help solidify your point. Also, consider adding more analysis or personal reflection on why Christina's view might be compelling despite your skepticism.

In terms of your writing ability, you clearly have a voice and a passion for the subject, which is fantastic. Your conversational style makes the essay accessible, but be mindful of clarity and conciseness. There are some sentences that felt a bit long or meandering, so breaking them up could help with readability. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend practicing more structured paragraphs. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea, beginning with a clear topic sentence. This will help your readers follow your thoughts more easily. Additionally, consider revising your drafts more thoroughly to catch spelling and grammar mistakes before submitting. Reading your work out loud can often help identify awkward phrasing or unclear sentences.

Overall, you have a solid foundation here, and with some polishing and additional depth in your arguments, your writing can really shine! Keep exploring your interests in topics like Mars; they can lead to some fascinating essays."

Right off the bat, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic and the personal connection you’ve made to the issue of car ownership and its environmental impact. It’s clear that you care about this subject, and your writing reflects a genuine desire to express your feelings about it. However, while your passion shines through, the essay could benefit from more organization and clarity to strengthen your argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you intertwine your personal experiences with broader environmental concerns. This approach makes your argument relatable and shows a thoughtful reflection on the implications of car usage. However, I noticed several areas where clarity and coherence could be improved. For example, your writing contains numerous grammatical errors and typos, such as “briving” instead of “driving” and “distroy” instead of “destroy.” These mistakes can distract readers from your message. Additionally, your ideas sometimes seem to jump around without clear transitions, making it hard to follow your thought process.

In terms of your argument and the examples you chose, there’s potential for a stronger connection between your personal anecdotes and the evidence from your sources. While you reference statistics about emissions and driving trends, you could delve deeper into how these figures relate to your own experiences and feelings about wanting a car. For instance, you could elaborate on how your mother’s perspective on reducing car use affects you personally and how it aligns with the statistics you presented. This would help create a more cohesive argument and make your points more compelling.

When considering your writing competency and style, it’s clear that you have a distinct voice that adds character to your essay. However, there are some weaknesses, particularly in grammar, sentence structure, and overall coherence. To enhance your writing, I recommend focusing on proofreading your work more carefully. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch errors and awkward phrases. Additionally, consider outlining your essay before writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and create a logical flow from one idea to the next.

Given your interest in the topic, I encourage you to explore it further. Research more about the environmental impacts of cars and examine various perspectives on transportation. This could provide you with a richer foundation for your arguments and make your writing even more compelling. 

In summary, your essay has a strong foundation and a personal touch, but it needs more clarity, organization, and attention to detail. Keep working on your writing skills, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas in future essays!"

What stands out immediately is your passion for the topic of vehicle emissions and the environment. You clearly care about making a difference, and that enthusiasm really comes through in your writing. Your argument about reducing car usage and finding alternatives is definitely relevant and important, especially in today's context of climate change.

However, there are some areas where your essay could use improvement. Firstly, the structure could be clearer. Right now, your ideas feel a bit jumbled, which makes it hard for the reader to follow your argument. It might help to organize your thoughts into distinct sections: an introduction that outlines your main point, several body paragraphs that each discuss a specific aspect of your argument, and a conclusion that wraps everything up. Additionally, be careful with spelling and grammar—errors like ""vehical"" instead of ""vehicle"" and ""artical"" instead of ""article"" can distract from your message.

In terms of your argument and examples, while you mention important points like biking and carpooling, your claims could benefit from more concrete evidence or examples. For instance, you could include statistics about carbon emissions or examples of cities that have successfully implemented car bans or bike-friendly infrastructure. This would strengthen your argument significantly and help persuade your readers that your ideas are viable.

Looking at your writing ability, it's clear you have a strong voice and a desire to engage with the topic, which is great. However, you do have some weaknesses in terms of clarity, grammar, and organization. It’s important to proofread your work and ensure that your sentences are well-structured. Consider working on sentence variety to make your writing more engaging. 

Since you seem interested in environmental issues, I suggest you read more about successful environmental policies and their impacts. This could provide you with additional examples to use in your writing. Additionally, practicing outlining your essays before you start writing can help you organize your thoughts more effectively.

To enhance your essay, I recommend starting with a strong thesis statement that clearly presents your main argument. Then, break down your points into separate paragraphs, each focusing on a single idea. Don’t forget to proofread for spelling and grammar mistakes, and consider diving deeper into research to back up your claims with solid examples. Keep writing—your passion for the subject will only grow stronger as you refine your skills!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your strong emotional reaction to the topic. It’s clear that you feel very passionately about the idea of leaving the past alone and not dwelling on someone's mood, which is an interesting perspective. However, the way you express these thoughts can be a bit chaotic, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument.

One of your strengths is your authentic voice; it feels like you’re speaking directly to the reader, which can engage them. However, the essay lacks clarity and structure. Sometimes, your points seem to jump around without clear connections, and that makes it challenging to understand your main argument. Focusing on a central idea and organizing your thoughts more clearly would really help your writing. Additionally, be careful with spelling and grammar, as errors can distract from your message.

In terms of argument evaluation, while you raise compelling points about the irrelevance of past emotions, you could enhance your argument by providing more context or examples. For instance, referencing specific historical figures or artworks could strengthen your case and illustrate your point more effectively. Right now, it feels like you’re making assertions without enough evidence to back them up, which weakens your overall argument.

When it comes to writing competency and style, you definitely have a lively way of expressing yourself. However, the informal tone can sometimes come off as overly casual for an essay format. While it's great to have a personal touch, balancing that with more formal language will help you convey your ideas more effectively. 

To improve, I recommend taking time to outline your main ideas before you start writing. Try writing a thesis statement that clearly states your main argument and then build your essay around that. Also, pay attention to sentence structure—varying your sentence lengths and types can help make your writing more engaging. Lastly, proofread your work to catch those spelling and grammar mistakes. 

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build on. With more focus and organization, your passionate voice can shine through much more clearly!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the emotional interpretation of the Mona Lisa, combined with the influence of technology on understanding human emotions. It’s clear that you find the intersection of art and emotion fascinating, which is great! You’ve tackled a complex topic, and that’s commendable.

However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved. First, the organization and clarity of your ideas need more attention. At times, it's hard to follow your train of thought because of grammatical errors and unclear phrasing. For example, there are several spelling mistakes (like “technologly” and “resson”) and awkward sentences that could confuse the reader. Focusing on sentence structure and proofreading your work more carefully will help you express your thoughts more clearly.

When it comes to your argument and examples, you start strong by referencing the Mona Lisa, but the connection between her emotions and modern technology feels a bit disjointed. While you mention “action units” and Eckman’s six basic emotions, there’s not enough elaboration on how these concepts relate back to the Mona Lisa. Strengthening this connection and providing more detailed examples would enhance your argument and make it more compelling.

In terms of writing competency and style, you’ve got a solid foundation, but the essay is hindered by frequent grammatical errors and typos. Your passion for the subject shines through, but refining your writing mechanics will elevate your work. 

One of your strengths is the way you engage with the topic; it seems like you’re genuinely interested in how technology can help us understand emotions better. However, you need to work on clarity and coherence. A good approach would be to plan your essay before writing, outlining key points you want to make, and then develop each point clearly and concisely.

I recommend revisiting your essay for clarity. Try breaking down complex ideas into simpler sentences and rephrasing any convoluted thoughts. Also, consider adding more supporting evidence for your claims about emotions and technology—maybe even some personal reflections or examples from your own experiences. Lastly, take the time to proofread for spelling and grammar, as these small details can greatly impact how your ideas are received.

Keep exploring this interesting intersection of art and technology; you have the potential to develop some really engaging insights!"

","Your essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out is your clear passion for the topic of limiting car use and its positive impact on the environment. You’ve chosen an important issue that many people are beginning to care about, and that’s a great start. It shows that you are engaged and want to make a difference, which is commendable. 

However, there are several areas that need improvement. The essay feels a bit disorganized, with some sentences that could be clearer. For instance, when you mention the percentage of greenhouse gases caused by cars, it would be helpful to provide more context or even a source for that statistic. Additionally, there are a few spelling and grammatical errors, such as “monther” instead of “mother” and “thoes” instead of “those.” These mistakes can distract from your message and undermine your credibility. 

Your argument about limiting car use is a solid one, especially when you mention the woman from Germany and the town that banned cars. However, it would be even stronger if you could include more specific examples or statistics to back up your claims. Perhaps you could elaborate on the benefits experienced by that town or provide more details about the woman’s experience. This would give your audience a clearer picture of the positive changes that can happen when we limit car use. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a good foundation, but your voice could use some refinement. While it’s great to be conversational, some of your sentences are a bit too informal or fragmented, which makes it harder to follow your thoughts. For example, “they had Feet” could be rephrased for clarity. 

One of your strengths is your ability to convey enthusiasm for the topic, which can be very engaging for readers. However, you might want to work on crafting more complex sentences and using varied sentence structures to enhance the flow of your writing. 

To improve, I recommend focusing on proofreading your work for spelling and grammar errors before submitting. Also, try to organize your thoughts more clearly. It might help to create an outline before you start writing to ensure your ideas flow logically. Lastly, consider incorporating more research and examples to support your arguments; this will not only strengthen your essay but also demonstrate your knowledge of the topic more effectively. Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas in future essays!"

What stands out immediately is your heartfelt attempt to engage with the topic of new technologies and their impact on emotions. It’s clear that you care about how these advancements might affect people, particularly in sensitive areas like feelings and personal experiences. This is a thoughtful angle, and it’s great to see you trying to connect it to real-life implications.

However, there are several areas where you could improve. For one, your writing needs more clarity and structure. Right now, it feels a bit scattered, which makes it hard for readers to follow your main ideas. It would help if you organized your thoughts more clearly, perhaps by stating your main argument at the beginning and then supporting it with examples and evidence. Make sure to proofread your work for spelling and grammar, as these mistakes can distract from your message.

When it comes to your argument, I think you have a solid foundation, but it needs more depth. You mention how a picture of a lady might show her hiding her feelings, which is a great observation. However, it would be even stronger if you elaborated on that point—what makes you think she is hiding her pain? Adding specific examples or quotes from the articles you referenced would help strengthen your argument and demonstrate that you’ve engaged with the material more deeply.

As for your writing ability, I see potential. You have a unique voice, which is an important strength. However, your writing style could benefit from more attention to detail. Pay careful attention to grammar, punctuation, and word choice, as these elements are crucial for conveying your ideas effectively. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend practicing writing more structured paragraphs. Start with a clear topic sentence, followed by supporting sentences that explain or expand on that idea. Also, make it a habit to proofread your work before submitting it. Reading your essay aloud can help identify awkward phrases or errors that you might not catch otherwise. 

Overall, I can see that you're interested in the topic, and that enthusiasm is a great asset. With some focused effort on organization and clarity, you can significantly enhance your essays. Keep writing and exploring your ideas!"

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Facial Action Coding System and its implications on understanding emotions. You’ve chosen an interesting topic that can lead to a lot of engaging discussions about communication and emotional intelligence. However, the essay feels a bit scattered, and the ideas don’t flow together as smoothly as they could. This makes it challenging for the reader to follow your argument.

One of the strengths of your writing is that you’re tackling a relevant and thought-provoking subject. You’ve made a good attempt to consider both the positive and negative effects of the Facial Action Coding System, which shows depth in your thinking. However, there are quite a few areas that need improvement. For instance, your sentence structure is quite choppy at times, and there are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your main points. It might help to break down your ideas into clearer, more structured paragraphs, each focusing on a single concept.

In terms of your argument and use of examples, the reference to the Mona Lisa is a compelling choice, but it could be developed further. You mention the percentages of her emotions according to the system, but you could explore why this is significant or how it reflects broader themes in emotional expression. Additionally, drawing connections between your example and real-life situations where this technology might be used could strengthen your argument. 

When it comes to your writing ability, it’s clear you have a good grasp of the topic, which is great since you seem interested in it. However, your writing style needs some refinement. One of the main weaknesses is that you have some spelling mistakes, like “sombody,” “wetther,” and “emberrass,” which can undermine the credibility of your essay. Pay attention to these details, as they can make a big difference. Moreover, consider varying your sentence structure to create a more engaging rhythm in your writing.

To enhance your essay, I recommend proofreading your work for spelling and grammar errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve the flow. Additionally, try to organize your thoughts more clearly. Start with an introduction that outlines your main argument, develop your points in the body paragraphs with clear examples, and conclude with a summary of your insights. Adding a few more details or examples will give your essay depth and make it more persuasive. Keep working on it; I can see you have the potential to express your views more clearly!"

","This essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa's expression. You’ve tried to delve into the emotions behind the artwork and connect them to the artist's intent, which is a great direction. However, the ideas feel a bit muddled and could benefit from clearer organization and more precise language to express your thoughts.

There are some strengths in your essay, especially in how you describe the Mona Lisa's smile and the atmosphere surrounding her. It’s clear that you’re trying to convey a deeper meaning behind the artwork. However, there are several areas where you could improve. The writing tends to be a bit disjointed, with some sentences feeling overly long and convoluted. Focusing on clearer sentence structure and breaking up your ideas into distinct paragraphs would help your readers follow along better.

Regarding your argument and the use of examples, while you touch on interesting points about the Mona Lisa's expression and the landscape, these ideas need more depth. For instance, you mention that the colors are muted, but it would strengthen your argument if you explained why this is significant in understanding the mood of the painting. Providing specific examples or comparisons to other artworks could also solidify your points.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a good grasp of the subject, suggesting that you have a genuine interest in art. However, your writing style needs refinement. There are numerous grammatical errors, and some phrases are awkwardly constructed. You might want to focus on punctuation and sentence clarity. Reading your essay aloud could help catch some of the areas where the flow feels off.

Moving forward, consider breaking your essay into more defined paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point. This will help clarify your argument. Additionally, try to include more specific examples to support your claims. For instance, when discussing the expression on the Mona Lisa’s face, you might want to reference other artists’ interpretations or similar works. Lastly, proofreading for grammar and sentence structure will elevate the overall quality of your essay. Keep working on it; you clearly have the passion and ideas—now it’s about honing your expression!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa's expression and the idea of using technology to alter it. It’s intriguing to think about how computers might change our understanding of art and emotion. However, the essay struggles with clarity and coherence, making it hard to follow your main ideas. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the creative angle you took by incorporating a modern twist on a classic masterpiece. It’s clear you have an interest in both art and technology, which can be a fascinating combination. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed. The writing has many grammatical errors and awkward phrases that detract from your message. For instance, phrases like ""the most best masterpiece"" and ""his a smile"" confuse the reader. Focusing on sentence structure and word choice would greatly enhance your writing. 

In terms of argument and examples, the essay lacks a strong, coherent argument. While you mention emotions and the role of technology, these ideas feel scattered and underdeveloped. It would help to focus on a clear thesis statement and support it with logical reasoning and specific examples. Instead of jumping between points, consider creating a structured outline before writing to ensure that each point builds on the last. 

Regarding your writing ability, you demonstrate a good understanding of the topic, but the execution needs work. Your enthusiasm for the subject is clear, which is a great starting point. However, your writing currently has issues with clarity, grammar, and organization. To develop your skills, I recommend reading more essays or articles on similar topics to see how ideas are structured and articulated. Additionally, practice revising your work, focusing on one aspect at a time, such as grammar in one draft and coherence in another. 

As you continue to explore this topic, think about developing a clear argument or thesis that you can support with evidence or examples. Try to clarify your thoughts before you start writing—this will help you create a more structured essay. Lastly, don’t hesitate to ask for feedback from peers or teachers before submitting your work; it can be incredibly helpful! Keep working on your writing, and I’m excited to see how you grow!"
F-M3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time.

In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

","This essay shows promise and earns a 3 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa's expression. It's refreshing to see someone challenge the conventional interpretations of such a famous piece of art. You bring up the idea that a facial expression can be misinterpreted, and it's a valid point. Your argument about the difficulty in reading emotions without context is an interesting angle that could lead to a deeper discussion about art and emotion.

However, there are a few areas where your writing could improve. First, some of your sentences are a bit long and can be hard to follow, which detracts from your overall argument. Breaking them up and using clearer transitions could help clarify your points. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""wasi"" instead of ""was"" and ""expiriencing"" instead of ""experiencing,"" which can distract the reader from your ideas. Paying closer attention to these details will strengthen your writing.

Your argument is intriguing, but it could benefit from more structured support. While you mention facial feedback theory, it would be helpful to explain that theory a bit more for readers who might not be familiar with it. Also, when you mention the lack of eyebrows affecting emotion perception, consider tying that back to your main argument about the Mona Lisa specifically. Adding relevant examples or references to other artworks that illustrate your points could further enrich your essay.

In terms of your writing style, you show a lot of potential, especially considering your interest in the topic. Your voice is engaging, but refining your sentence structure and grammar would enhance clarity and professionalism. Focus on varying your sentence lengths and ensuring your arguments flow logically from one to the next. 

To take your essay to the next level, I recommend revisiting your thesis statement to make it more concise and clear. Then, consider organizing your arguments in a way that builds on each point logically. This could involve creating a brief outline before you start writing. Lastly, proofreading your work or using tools to check for grammar and spelling mistakes could save you from minor errors that could detract from your argument. Keep exploring this fascinating topic—there’s so much more you can delve into regarding art and emotion!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Facial Coding System and its limitations, especially in relation to understanding emotions accurately. It's clear you have some strong feelings about the topic, and that passion is important in writing. 

However, there are several areas that need improvement. The essay lacks organization and clarity. Sentences often run on without proper punctuation, making it hard to follow your arguments. For instance, breaking up your ideas into clearer, shorter sentences would greatly enhance readability. Additionally, introducing your main argument at the start would help guide your readers through your thoughts better.

Your argument against the Facial Coding System has the potential to be compelling, especially since you mention the Mona Lisa and interpretations of art. However, you could strengthen your case by providing more structured reasoning and evidence. You mention that we can't know how someone feels unless we ask them, which is a valid point, but it would be more effective if you elaborated on this idea with examples of situations where facial expressions might be misleading. 

In terms of writing ability, you have a good foundation but need to work on clarity, grammar, and structure. Strengths include your enthusiasm for the topic and your ability to express an opinion. On the flip side, the weaknesses lie in the organization of your thoughts and the mechanics of your writing. 

To develop your skills, I recommend practicing breaking down your ideas into paragraphs, each with a clear focus. Try to use transition words to guide readers through your arguments, and don't hesitate to ask for feedback on drafts before the final submission. Additionally, reading essays or articles on similar topics can help you see how others structure their arguments and use examples effectively. 

Overall, keep exploring your thoughts on this subject, but take the time to refine your writing style and clarity. With practice, I believe you'll be able to express your ideas more effectively."

What stands out immediately is your clear understanding of the challenges that studying Venus presents. You’ve done a solid job summarizing the author's main points and supporting details, which shows that you grasp the subject well. It’s great to see your ability to recognize the complexities of space exploration and the innovative solutions being proposed.

 

One of your strengths lies in your organization. You’ve structured your essay logically, guiding the reader through the arguments presented. Additionally, your mention of NASA’s plans adds credibility to your discussion. However, I noticed a few areas where you could improve. For instance, some of your sentences could be more concise. Clarifying your language would enhance readability and impact. Also, be careful with spelling; ""milles"" should be ""miles,"" and ""counditions"" should be ""conditions."" These kinds of errors can distract from your overall message.

 

When it comes to evaluating the argument and the examples you used, I think you did a decent job demonstrating how the author supports the claim that studying Venus is worthwhile. However, it would strengthen your essay to delve deeper into how these solutions might actually work in practice or their potential limitations. Exploring counterarguments or addressing the feasibility of the proposed solutions could give your essay more depth and show that you’ve thought critically about the topic.

 

In terms of your writing ability, you exhibit a solid foundation but seem to struggle a bit with clarity and flow. Your voice comes through, which is a positive aspect; however, refining your sentence structure and being mindful of word choice will significantly enhance your writing style. 

 

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on proofreading your work for spelling and grammar errors, as well as practicing varying your sentence structure. Reading more essays on similar topics could help you see how other writers articulate their arguments and present evidence. Additionally, consider asking yourself questions like, ""What are the broader implications of this issue?"" or ""How might these solutions evolve in the future?"" These reflections could add layers to your analysis and improve your overall argumentation.

 

Overall, you have a solid understanding of the topic and the potential of space exploration, especially concerning Venus. Keep honing your skills, and I look forward to seeing how your writing evolves!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile Again."" It’s clear that you’re interested in the subject and want to explore the nuances of the painting and its interpretation. However, the essay feels a bit disjointed and lacks clarity in presenting your main points.

One of the strengths of your writing is your enthusiasm for the topic, which can engage your readers. However, the organization of your ideas needs improvement. For instance, you mention several paragraphs and their contents but don’t provide a clear structure or flow that connects these ideas effectively. It would benefit your writing to ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that your thoughts develop logically. 

Your argument about why the computer model's version of the Mona Lisa is ""better"" could be strengthened with more detail and explanation. You mention that the computer model has ""better details"" and ""tightens his lips,"" but it would be helpful to elaborate on why these features are significant or how they alter the viewer's perception. Additionally, referencing specific examples or analyses from art criticism could enhance your argument. 

Regarding your writing ability, you show a basic understanding of essay structure, but it needs more refinement. The sentence construction is somewhat awkward, and there are several spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your overall message. Focusing on sentence clarity and proper grammar will improve your writing significantly. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend practicing outlining your essays before writing. This can help you organize your thoughts more clearly. Additionally, reading more about the Mona Lisa and other famous artworks might give you deeper insights and ideas to explore in your writing. Lastly, consider revising your sentences for clarity and coherence, and don’t hesitate to ask for feedback on your drafts before finalizing your essay. 

Keep working on it! You have the foundation for a thoughtful essay; it just needs some polishing."

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the technology that reads emotional expressions, particularly the connection you made to the Mona Lisa. It's a creative way to engage the reader and link art to modern technology, which is a fascinating topic. However, the ideas could be presented more clearly and cohesively.

Your discussion of how computers analyze facial expressions is intriguing, and you mention some key points about the universality of emotions and the complexity of human facial movements. However, the essay has several grammatical and spelling errors that distract from your message. For instance, phrases like ""fro read the emotionals expressions"" and ""can be change his smile"" need correction. These mistakes can make it difficult for readers to grasp your meaning, so working on sentence structure and word choice is essential.

When it comes to the argument and examples you've provided, the connection between the Mona Lisa and modern facial recognition technology is a strong one, but it needs more development. You mention how computers can determine fake versus real smiles, which is a great point, but it would be beneficial to include more details or examples to support your claims. This could involve discussing specific technologies or studies that demonstrate how this process works. 

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you have a good interest in the topic, and that enthusiasm is a strength! However, the essay could benefit from more attention to clarity and organization. Make sure each sentence flows logically into the next, and consider revising your work to focus on clear, grammatically correct language. 

To enhance your essay, start by proofreading for spelling and grammar. Then, try to outline your main points before writing to ensure a more organized flow. Additionally, expanding on your examples with more context and detail will help make your argument stronger. Exploring how this technology could impact real-world situations or adding more examples beyond just the Mona Lisa would enrich your essay. Keep writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback as you continue to develop your skills!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your creative take on the discovery of the mask on Mars. You’ve woven a narrative that captures the curiosity that comes with exploring the unknown. I can see your interest in this topic and how excited you are about the possibilities of life beyond Earth, which is fantastic!

However, there are several areas in which you could improve. For starters, the essay has quite a few grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""Christina"" being misspelled as ""Christna,"" and phrases like ""me and my partner"" could be more formally phrased as ""my partner and I."" Additionally, the organization is a bit muddled; it jumps between thoughts without clear transitions, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument. 

Your argument has some interesting points, but it would benefit from clearer structure and stronger support. The example you provided about NASA's unveiling is relevant, but you need to elaborate more on how it refutes Christina’s theory. Explaining why the evidence suggests it’s a natural formation rather than an alien artifact would make your argument stronger. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you’ve got a lively voice that shines through, which is great! However, the flow of your writing is often interrupted by awkward phrasing and run-on sentences that can confuse the reader. For instance, breaking down complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones would help convey your ideas better. 

To enhance your essay, try to focus on organizing your thoughts more clearly. Start with an introduction that outlines your main points, then expand on each one in separate paragraphs. Pay attention to grammar and sentence structure, as these are crucial for clarity. Finally, consider adding more detailed explanations and examples to support your claims. This will help to solidify your argument and make your conclusion more compelling. Keep up the enthusiasm for the topic, and use that interest to drive your revisions!"

What stands out immediately is your personal connection to the topic of cars and transportation. You clearly express your frustration and desire for a car, which makes your writing relatable. I appreciate how you tie your personal experience to broader issues like environmental impact and traffic, as it brings depth to your argument.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. First, the organization of your essay feels a bit scattered. It jumps from personal anecdotes to facts and sources without a clear structure. It would help to clearly define your main argument and then support it with logical reasoning and evidence. Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your message. For example, ""distroy"" should be ""destroy,"" and ""are"" should be ""our."" Paying attention to these details will enhance your credibility as a writer.

Your argument has potential, especially when you discuss the environmental impact of cars and the benefits of alternative transportation methods. However, it would be stronger if you provided specific examples and data in a more organized way. For instance, when you mention that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions,"" consider elaborating on what that means for the average person and how reducing car use can make a difference. 

In terms of your writing ability, you definitely have a unique voice, which is a strength. However, the numerous spelling mistakes and grammatical errors indicate that more attention to detail is necessary. I recommend revising your essay for clarity and correctness before submitting it. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve the flow of your writing. 

Since you seem really interested in the topic of cars and their impact, consider researching more about alternative transportation options and their benefits. This could help you provide a more balanced perspective and strengthen your argument. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest creating an outline before you start writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure each part of your essay connects back to your main argument. Additionally, consider using transition sentences to connect your ideas and guide the reader through your argument more smoothly. Finally, take the time to proofread your work or ask someone else to review it for clarity and correctness. Keep writing and exploring your thoughts; you have the foundation for an engaging essay!"

What stands out immediately is your clear passion for the topic of reducing carbon emissions and the ways we can shift away from reliance on personal vehicles. It’s evident that you have strong feelings about the environment and the changes that need to be made. This enthusiasm is a great foundation for your writing.

However, there are several areas that need improvement. Firstly, the organization of your essay feels a bit scattered, which makes it hard to follow your main points. It’s important to have a clear structure with a strong introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a single idea, and a conclusion that wraps everything up. Also, pay attention to spelling and grammar; there are quite a few errors that distract from your message. For instance, ""vehicals"" should be ""vehicles,"" and ""differnce"" should be ""difference."" These small mistakes add up and can make your argument seem less credible.

In terms of your argument, while you present some interesting ideas about how to reduce carbon emissions, they would be even stronger if you backed them up with data or examples. You mention that personal vehicles are the second-largest producer of carbon emissions, but you could enhance your argument by citing specific studies or statistics from credible sources. Additionally, the idea of banning cars on certain days is provocative, but you could explore potential counterarguments or address how this might impact people’s daily lives.

Your writing style shows potential, but it could benefit from more clarity and coherence. Some sentences are quite long and could be broken down to improve readability. For example, the sentence about treating the Earth like a ""father"" is creative but could be clearer if you focused on one main idea at a time. 

Since you're interested in environmental issues, I suggest reading more about the topic to gather facts and perspectives that can enrich your arguments. Consider using outlines before you start writing to organize your thoughts clearly. Finally, practice proofreading your work or using tools to catch spelling and grammatical errors before submitting.

Overall, you have a strong foundation to build upon, and with some revisions, you can create a compelling and well-structured argument. Keep exploring your ideas, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into research to support your claims!"

What stands out immediately is your raw emotion and passion for the topic. You clearly feel strongly about the idea of not dwelling on the past, and that's a powerful sentiment. Your voice comes through strongly, and it's evident that you're not afraid to express your opinions, which is a great quality in writing. 

However, the essay struggles with clarity and organization. Many of your points come across as jumbled and can be a bit difficult to follow. The lack of punctuation and run-on sentences make it hard for readers to grasp your main ideas. It would be beneficial to take a moment to structure your thoughts before writing, maybe even jotting down key points you want to address in a more organized manner. This would help you articulate your arguments more effectively.

As for your argument, while you have some interesting ideas about the irrelevance of past emotions, you don't provide specific examples that could strengthen your point. Consider referencing specific instances or historical figures to illustrate why you believe understanding someone's mood is unnecessary. For example, you mention the Mona Lisa—why not delve deeper into that artwork's history or the artist's intent? This can help solidify your claims and provide context for your readers.

Your writing style shows potential, particularly in how you convey your feelings, but it could use refinement. The informal tone can work in your favor, but it also risks making your arguments seem less serious. Pay attention to grammar and punctuation, as these are crucial for clarity. When you feel the urge to express your thoughts, take a moment to breathe and think about how to present them in a way that will resonate with your audience.

Since you seem to have a strong opinion about the topic, I encourage you to explore it further. Try reading more about the importance of emotional context in art or literature. This could give you a wider perspective and help you articulate your views more convincingly. 

To enhance your essay, focus on organizing your thoughts into clear, coherent paragraphs. Use specific examples to back up your claims, and take the time to proofread for grammar and punctuation. This will not only improve the readability of your work but also strengthen your argument. Keep writing and refining your ideas—you have the makings of a strong voice!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5.

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Mona Lisa and emotions, which is an interesting angle. You’ve attempted to connect technology with emotional recognition in art, and that’s a compelling theme. However, the execution of your ideas needs more clarity and organization to effectively communicate your thoughts.

While you have some interesting insights, there are significant areas for improvement. For instance, there are many spelling and grammatical errors throughout your essay that make it hard to follow. Additionally, some sentences are confusing and could benefit from clearer structure. Working on these aspects will greatly enhance the readability of your writing. 

Your argument touches on the importance of understanding emotions and how technology can help with that, but it feels a bit scattered. For example, you mention the “action unit” concept and Ekman’s classification of emotions, but these points could be better linked to your main thesis. Also, when referencing Mona Lisa, the transition between her emotions and the technology you discuss could be smoother. It’s important to provide specific examples and explore how they relate back to your main argument.

In terms of your writing competency and style, you show potential with your ideas, but the clarity of your expression needs work. Your unique voice comes through, but it sometimes gets lost in the errors and disorganized structure. A key strength is your engagement with the topic, showing that you are interested in the emotional aspects of art and technology. However, the weaknesses include grammar, punctuation, and coherence. 

To improve, consider taking a bit more time to outline your essay before writing. This can help ensure your points flow logically from one to the next. Additionally, revising your work for grammar and spelling will make your arguments much stronger. Reading your essay aloud might also help you catch awkward phrasing or unclear sentences. Lastly, try to connect your examples back to your main argument more explicitly, making sure each point reinforces your thesis. 

With practice and focused revisions, I believe you can develop your writing skills further. Keep exploring your interests in this fascinating topic!"

","The essay shows promise and earns a 2 out of 5. 

What stands out immediately is your clear passion for the topic of limiting car use and its positive impact on the environment. It’s great that you’re addressing such an important issue, and your engagement with the subject shines through. However, the essay needs more structure and clarity to effectively convey your ideas to the reader.

You have some good ideas here, like the mention of how people used to get around before cars and the benefits of reducing car use. However, there are several areas that need improvement. For instance, spelling and grammar issues, like “monther” instead of “mother” and “thoes” instead of “those,” can distract readers from your message. Additionally, your arguments would be stronger if you provided more specific evidence or examples to back them up. The quote from the man in Germany is a good start, but it would be beneficial to elaborate on it and explain how it relates to your main points.

Your argument about the benefits of limiting car use is relevant and important, but it could be more persuasive if you provided additional examples or statistics. You mentioned that “experts say” cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases, but including the source or explaining how this impacts the environment would make your argument more compelling. The anecdote about the town that banned cars is interesting, but it could be expanded upon to illustrate how such a change positively affected the community’s quality of life.

Your writing style shows potential, but it could use more polish. There are several spelling and grammar errors that could be corrected, which would help your ideas come across more clearly. Additionally, be mindful of sentence structure; some sentences feel a bit choppy or run-on, which can confuse the reader. Focusing on crafting more complete and coherent sentences will help enhance your overall writing style.

Strengths in your writing include your enthusiasm for the topic and your ability to convey a sense of urgency about the need to change our habits regarding car use. On the flip side, the weaknesses lie largely in the technical aspects of writing—grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend taking the time to proofread your work before submission. This will help you catch those pesky typos and grammatical errors. Additionally, consider outlining your essay before you start writing. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your argument flows logically from one point to the next. Lastly, try to incorporate more detailed examples and research to bolster your arguments. This will not only make your essay stronger but also demonstrate your depth of knowledge on the topic.

Remember, your interest in this subject is a great asset, and with some focused attention on your writing skills, you can make your arguments even more compelling and impactful!"

What stands out immediately is your attempt to engage with a complex and emotional topic regarding technology and feelings. It’s clear that you have strong feelings about the subject, which is important in writing. However, the ideas you’re trying to express need more clarity and structure to really shine.

One of the strengths here is your personal connection to the topic. It’s great that you are considering how new technology might impact people emotionally. This perspective adds a valuable layer to your argument. However, there are some areas for improvement. Your grammar and spelling need attention, as there are several errors that make it difficult to understand your points. Additionally, organizing your ideas into clear paragraphs would help your argument flow better. 

In terms of argument and examples, you do reference an article, which is a good start, but it would be more effective to elaborate on your evidence and connect it back to your main point more clearly. For instance, when you mention a person’s expression, it could be helpful to explain why that matters in relation to your argument about technology. Instead of stating that a person might be hiding their feelings, consider exploring how technology could impact genuine emotional expression.

When it comes to your writing ability, you show a willingness to express your thoughts, but there are some weaknesses in sentence structure and word choice. Try to vary your sentences and use more precise vocabulary to express your ideas. It might help to read your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrases or unclear sentences. 

Since you seem interested in this topic, I recommend diving deeper into the emotional implications of technology. Consider researching how technology has affected communication and emotional expression in real-life scenarios. This could not only strengthen your argument but also provide you with specific examples to include in your essay.

To enhance your writing, focus on proofreading for spelling and grammar errors before submitting. Breaking your ideas into distinct paragraphs will also make your argument easier to follow. Lastly, expanding on your examples with more detail will make your points stronger and more persuasive. Keep writing and exploring these ideas!"

What stands out immediately is your unique perspective on the Facial Action Coding System and its implications for understanding emotions. You’ve touched on an important aspect of communication—the idea that people often don’t express their feelings verbally. This is a relevant and thoughtful observation that can resonate with many readers.

However, while your ideas are interesting, there are areas that need improvement. First, the organization of your essay could be clearer. It would help to have distinct paragraphs for the introduction, body, and conclusion. This structure allows your readers to follow your thoughts more easily. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""sombody"" instead of ""somebody,"" and ""emberrass"" instead of ""embarrass."" Taking the time to proofread can make a big difference in conveying your ideas effectively.

When discussing the Facial Action Coding System, you gave a specific example regarding the Mona Lisa, which is great! However, it would strengthen your argument if you elaborated on how this system works in practice. You mentioned that it could make some people uncomfortable, but you might want to explore this idea further. Are there specific situations where this could be particularly problematic? Adding more depth to your examples can enrich your argument and engage your readers more fully.

As a student interested in this topic, your writing competency shows potential, but there are some weaknesses that need addressing. Clarity is key, and simplifying your language in some areas could help your message come through stronger. Work on sentence structure and coherence; some sentences felt a bit run-on and could be broken down for better clarity.

For targeted development, I recommend practicing your proofreading skills. Consider reading your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing or errors that might be overlooked when reading silently. Additionally, try outlining your thoughts before writing to help organize your ideas and ensure each paragraph has a clear focus.

Overall, your passion for the subject is evident, and with some refinement in structure and clarity, your writing can become even more impactful. Keep up the effort, and don’t hesitate to dive deeper into your arguments!"
