You've put together an essay that shows your enthusiasm for Luke and his journey, which is great! It’s clear that you care about your subject and want to convey your thoughts, but there are several areas where you could improve to make your writing more effective and clear.

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the topic. You really seem to understand Luke's desire to be a Seagoing Cowboy and how much that means to him. However, the essay lacks structure and clarity. Your ideas seem to jump around a lot, which makes it hard to follow your main points. Try to organize your thoughts more clearly—perhaps start with an introduction about who Luke is and what he wants, then move into why joining the program could be beneficial for him, and finally conclude with a strong statement about his journey.

When it comes to your argument, while you mention some good points about Luke wanting to help and be happy, the examples could be more specific. Instead of saying “this program might actually help him with something,” consider detailing what skills or experiences he could gain from the program. This would make your argument stronger and give the reader a clearer picture of Luke’s potential benefits.

In terms of writing style, you’ve got a conversational tone that can be appealing, but it also needs more polish. There are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. For instance, “actullay” should be “actually,” and ""dissions"" should be ""decisions."" Paying attention to these details will help make your writing clearer and more professional.

Your enthusiasm is a strong asset, and it’s clear you care about being a good person and making wise choices. To develop further, I recommend practicing writing more structured essays, perhaps by outlining your main points before you start writing. This could help you stay focused and organized. Additionally, consider reading more essays or articles on similar topics to see how others present their arguments effectively.

To enhance your essay, try reworking it by first creating a clear outline. Start with an introduction that explains who Luke is and what he wants. Then, build a paragraph around how the program could help him achieve his goals, using specific examples. Finally, end with a strong conclusion that reinforces the importance of following one’s passion and dreams. This will help guide your reader through your thoughts in a more cohesive way, making your arguments much more compelling. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you can refine this essay!"
M2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

Your essay presents some interesting points about why Luke should not be a sea-going cowboy, but there are areas where you could improve your clarity and argumentation. 

Overall, I appreciate your attempt to engage with the topic. You convey a sense of urgency about the dangers Luke faces, particularly during World War II. Your focus on the risks like getting hurt or seasick suggests you understand the gravity of the situation. However, the way you've structured your essay makes it a bit hard to follow. The flow of ideas could be smoother, and the organization needs some attention to make your points clearer.

One of the strengths of your essay is the passion you show for the topic. You clearly understand that being a sea-going cowboy is not just a romantic notion—it comes with real dangers. Still, your argument could be much stronger with more detailed examples and clearer connections between your points. For instance, when you mention the potential for Luke to be attacked by air troopers, it would help to explain why that matters in the broader context of his job. Additionally, some of your phrases are unclear or contain grammatical errors, which can distract from your message. 

In terms of your writing ability, you have a good foundation, but there are several areas for growth. Your ideas are there, but they often get lost in awkward phrasing or run-on sentences. Strengthening your grammar and punctuation will help make your writing more polished. You also need to work on organizing your thoughts more logically. Try outlining your essay before you write it. This can help you see how your points connect and ensure that each paragraph has a clear focus.

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic of sea-going cowboys, consider diving deeper into research about their experiences during World War II. This could provide you with additional examples and context that would enrich your argument. When you make a claim, try to back it up with specific evidence from your sources. This will not only strengthen your argument but also show your engagement with the material.

To enhance your essay, start by revising your sentences for clarity. Break down longer sentences into shorter ones and watch for grammar mistakes. Make sure each paragraph has a clear main idea that connects back to your thesis. Finally, consider incorporating more specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate the dangers of being a sea-going cowboy during this time. Doing so will help engage your readers and make your argument more compelling. Keep working on your writing; you're on the right track!"

I appreciate your effort in sharing your thoughts about Luke and the Seagoing Cowboys program. It’s clear that you have a genuine interest in this topic, and your enthusiasm really comes through in your writing. You’ve tackled a unique subject, and I can see that you’re trying to convey how important this program is to Luke.

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the subject. Your desire to help animals and explore new places shines through, which is really engaging. However, the essay has several areas that need improvement. The structure is a bit jumbled, which makes it hard to follow your main points. You might want to focus on organizing your thoughts more clearly. Take a moment to outline your ideas before you start writing; this can help you create a more logical flow. 

When it comes to your argument about Luke and the program, you do provide some interesting insights, but they could be backed up with more specific details. For example, mentioning what kinds of jobs he has or giving a clearer explanation of how he got into the program would strengthen your case. Right now, it feels a bit like a stream of consciousness, so try to focus on one main idea per sentence and expand on it with examples. 

Your writing style shows potential, but there are some areas that need work. There are quite a few grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, like ""like's"" instead of ""likes,"" and ""type's"" instead of ""types."" These can distract from your message. It might help to proofread your work or use a spell-check tool before submitting. Also, remember to keep your sentences clear and concise. Some of your sentences are quite long and could be broken down into shorter, more digestible parts. 

Since you seem interested in the Seagoing Cowboys program, I encourage you to dig deeper into the subject. Maybe include more about what you think makes the program valuable or how it impacts the animals and the people involved. This will give your essay more depth and show your reader that you really understand the topic. 

Overall, you have a good start, but with a bit more organization, attention to detail, and deeper exploration of your ideas, your writing can improve significantly. Keep at it; your passion for the subject is a great foundation to build on!"

Overall, your essay presents an interesting perspective on why people might want to pursue a job they enjoy, particularly in a cowboy-like role that involves adventure and travel across the sea. The enthusiasm for the topic shines through, which is a great start. However, the essay struggles with clarity and organization, making it difficult for readers to follow your main points. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the subject matter. It’s clear you appreciate the lifestyle you’re writing about, which is important when trying to persuade others. However, there are several areas that need improvement. The spelling and grammar issues make it hard to read; for example, words like ""sould,"" ""becuse,"" and ""acrossed"" should be corrected. The essay also lacks a clear structure, which makes your arguments feel a bit jumbled. It would help to have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion to guide your readers through your thoughts.

In terms of your argument, you mention that people should pursue this job because they might enjoy it, but you don’t provide specific examples or experiences that could strengthen your argument. You mention a character who takes a job in 1947, but this could be expanded to explain what makes that experience relevant today. Adding personal anecdotes or more detailed examples would give your points more weight.

Looking at your writing ability, I see that you have a good foundational understanding of expressing your ideas. However, the mechanics of writing—like grammar, spelling, and punctuation—need significant attention. Your enthusiasm is a real strength, and if you can channel that into clearer writing, it will make your essays much more engaging. 

To improve, I recommend taking some time to proofread your work before submitting it. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and see where your ideas might be unclear. Additionally, consider structuring your essay with clear paragraphs—each with a main idea. You might also benefit from practicing writing shorter, focused pieces to help you organize your thoughts more effectively. Lastly, incorporating specific examples or stories related to your topic will make your arguments more compelling and relatable. Keep writing and refining your skills; your passion is a solid foundation to build on!"
M5,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

Overall Impression

You’ve made a strong effort to express your thoughts about the passage and the idea of being a seagoing cowboy. It’s clear that you understand the main points and the excitement surrounding this adventurous lifestyle. However, your essay could benefit from more organization and clarity. Some of your sentences are a bit jumbled, which makes it harder for the reader to follow your ideas. Overall, though, it's an interesting take!

Strengths and Areas for Improvement

One of the strengths of your essay is that you highlight the adventurous aspects of being a seagoing cowboy, which can be very appealing to young boys. You mention specific locations like China and Greece, which adds a sense of excitement and possibility. On the flip side, some areas need attention. For instance, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""havig"" instead of ""having"" and ""satses"" instead of ""states."" These mistakes can distract the reader and take away from your message. Additionally, try to group similar ideas together for better flow. 

Evaluation of Argument and Use of Examples/Cases

Your argument is compelling, especially when you emphasize the fun elements of the job and the opportunities it presents. However, you could strengthen your argument by including more details or examples from the passage to support your claims. For instance, when you mention what he did as a child, you could elaborate on how those experiences prepared him for life at sea. This would make your argument more robust and engaging.

Writing Competency and Style

Your writing shows potential, but it needs refinement. You have a conversational tone, which is great for connecting with the reader, but make sure to clarify your sentences and check for grammar errors. Pay attention to punctuation, as it can help break up your thoughts and make them easier to understand. While you’re passionate about the topic, which is fantastic, aim to present your ideas more clearly.

Strengths and Weaknesses

Your enthusiasm for the topic shines through, and that’s a real asset. However, the organization of your ideas could improve, as some points seem scattered or repetitive. Consider outlining your essay before writing it to help ensure a logical flow of thoughts. Also, be mindful of sentence structure to avoid run-on sentences or fragments.

Targeted Development Recommendations

To enhance your essay, I suggest revising for clarity and organization. Start by grouping your thoughts into clear paragraphs, each focusing on a specific idea or aspect of the passage. Additionally, take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammar mistakes. Reading your essay out loud can also help you catch awkward phrases or unclear sentences. Finally, try to provide more supporting examples from the text to strengthen your argument. 

In conclusion, you have a solid foundation to build on, and with some revisions and attention to detail, your essay could be much stronger! Keep up the enthusiasm, and don’t hesitate to explore more aspects of the topic in your writing."

First off, I appreciate your effort in sharing Luke Bomberger's story. It’s clear that you have a genuine interest in this topic, and you’ve captured some exciting elements from Luke's experiences. The idea of portraying him as a hero and highlighting the adventure he embarked on is a strong foundation for your essay. However, there are areas where the clarity and structure could be significantly improved to enhance your overall message.

In terms of strengths, you’ve introduced a compelling character and provided a glimpse into both the fun and the hardships of being a seagoing cowboy. The details about the activities and the dangers he faced add a nice touch to the narrative. However, there are several areas where you could work on your writing. For instance, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your story. Words like ""grocery,"" ""tournaments,"" and ""caught"" need to be spelled correctly, and it's important to ensure proper punctuation and sentence structure. 

Your argument about why Luke wanted to be a seagoing cowboy is a good start, but it feels a bit rushed. You mention that it was an opportunity of a lifetime, but elaborating on this point would strengthen your argument. Why was this opportunity special? What did Luke hope to gain from it? Adding more context and depth to your reasoning would help the reader connect better with his motivations.

Looking at your writing style, I can see you have a creative voice that can shine through with a little refining. Your enthusiasm for the subject is evident, which is great! However, the flow of your sentences could be smoother. Sometimes, thoughts feel choppy or incomplete, making it a little hard for readers to follow your ideas. Focusing on constructing complete sentences and ensuring that each sentence logically transitions to the next will make your writing stronger. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest taking some time to proofread for spelling and grammar errors. You might also want to try outlining your essay before writing to help with organization. Consider expanding on key points, especially regarding Luke’s motivations and experiences. Adding a personal touch or reflection on what being a seagoing cowboy means to you or to others could also enrich your narrative. 

In conclusion, you’ve laid a solid foundation with your essay, and with some revisions and deeper exploration of your ideas, it could be even more engaging. Keep up the great work, and I’m looking forward to seeing how you develop your writing further!"
M7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

Your essay presents some interesting points about the Seagoing Cowboys program, and I appreciate the enthusiasm you show for the topic. It's clear that you found Luke's experiences inspiring, which is a great starting point for your writing. However, there are areas where your essay could be clearer and more effective in communicating your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your personal connection to the topic. You seem genuinely interested in the Seagoing Cowboys program, and you convey a sense of excitement about the experiences it offers. Additionally, you mention specific locations that Luke visited, which adds some depth to your argument. However, I noticed several spelling errors and grammatical mistakes that detract from your overall message. Words like ""exsperences,"" ""abourd,"" and ""aggre"" should be corrected to enhance the professionalism of your writing. Also, make sure to proofread for clarity and coherence, as some sentences felt a bit choppy or unclear.

Your argument about why someone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is a solid foundation. However, you could strengthen your points by including more specific examples from the text. For instance, when you mention the activities on board, it would be beneficial to elaborate on how these experiences specifically impacted Luke's life. Additionally, rather than simply stating that he became a nightwatchman, you could explore what that role taught him or how it contributed to his personal growth. This would create a richer, more engaging narrative.

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you're on the right track, especially in expressing your thoughts and feelings about the program. However, your writing would benefit from more attention to detail in spelling and structure. It's important to take the time to revise and edit your work before submitting it. A good practice would be to read your essay out loud or have someone else read it to catch any awkward phrasing or mistakes.

To enhance your essay, start by revising those spelling errors and focusing on sentence structure. Consider adding more detail to your examples and elaborating on how Luke's experiences shaped his life and values. Maybe include a personal reflection on how you see yourself in a similar role or what you hope to gain from such an experience. These adjustments will help make your essay more compelling and insightful. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing your revisions!"
M8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.","

Your essay presents an interesting perspective on the story and explores how Luke’s thoughts and feelings could change if the narrative were told in the first person. You’ve brought up several key points about how this change would allow readers to connect more deeply with Luke's experiences. It’s clear that you’re engaged with the topic, which makes for a compelling read.

One of the strengths of your essay is the enthusiasm you have for the subject. You clearly care about Luke’s character and his experiences. You’ve made a strong attempt to consider various aspects of his journey, from his friendships to his family, and even his reflections on his job. However, there are areas that could use improvement. Your essay is a bit repetitive at times, which makes it feel longer than necessary. Additionally, some sentences are a bit unclear or contain grammatical errors that can distract from your ideas.

When evaluating your argument, you’ve provided some good insights into how first-person narration could enhance the story. However, you could strengthen your argument by adding more specific examples or quotes from the text to support your claims. For instance, you mention that Luke would think nice things about helping people, but it would be helpful to include a direct reference to the story that illustrates this point. Also, try to organize your thoughts more clearly—perhaps you could group similar ideas together to create a smoother flow.

In terms of your writing abilities, you show a solid foundation, but there are definitely areas for growth. Your voice comes through nicely, and it feels like you have a genuine interest in the topic. However, working on clarity and sentence structure will really help you communicate your ideas more effectively. Pay attention to punctuation and spelling as well, as these mistakes can sometimes cloud your message. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend revising for clarity and organization. Start by outlining your main points before writing, which can help you avoid repetition and keep your ideas focused. Make sure to proofread your work to catch any spelling or grammatical errors. Lastly, consider incorporating specific examples from the text to back up your arguments, which will make your essay even stronger. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you apply this feedback in your next writing!"

First off, I want to acknowledge the effort you've put into this essay about Luke Bomberger and his experiences during World War II. It’s clear you have a genuine interest in this topic, and that enthusiasm shows in your writing. You’ve crafted a narrative that gives us a glimpse into Luke’s life and challenges, which is a great starting point for connecting with your readers.

However, there are several areas where the essay could use some improvement. One of the most noticeable issues is clarity; at times, the sentences are a bit jumbled and hard to follow. For example, the timeline of events isn’t always clear, and some phrases are confusing due to grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. These issues can distract the reader from the powerful story you want to tell. Additionally, while you include a lot of interesting details about Luke’s experiences, they sometimes feel scattered and could benefit from more organization to guide the reader through the narrative.

Your essay does a good job of attempting to convey Luke's experiences and emotions, which is a strength. However, the argument could be more effective with clearer connections between his experiences and the broader themes of war and personal growth. For example, you mention that he learned about running, shooting, and making friends, but these points could be woven more tightly into the narrative to illustrate how they shaped him as a person. Including specific instances or anecdotes could help enhance the emotional impact of your writing.

In terms of writing ability, you're showing promise, especially with your storytelling. I appreciate your effort to include dialogue and personal reflections, which can really bring a character to life. However, there are several areas that need attention. For starters, focus on sentence structure; many sentences are run-ons or fragments, which makes the writing feel disjointed. Pay careful attention to spelling and grammar as well. These technical aspects can greatly affect how your message comes across. 

To develop your skills further, I suggest practicing writing shorter, clearer sentences. Try summarizing your main points before expanding on them, which can help with organization. Additionally, consider reading more historical fiction or narratives about World War II; this could inspire you and show you how others effectively convey emotion and detail in their writing. When you edit your work, take the time to read it aloud; this can help you catch mistakes and see where the flow might be improved.

Overall, you have the foundation of a compelling story here. With some focused revisions and attention to clarity and structure, I believe you can create a more polished and impactful essay. Keep writing and refining your skills!"

First off, I want to say that I appreciate your enthusiasm for the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode Waves."" It's clear that you enjoyed the experience Luke had, and your excitement comes through in your writing. It’s always great to see a student engaged with the material. However, the essay could benefit from a bit more structure and clarity to help your thoughts shine through more effectively.

You did a nice job capturing the essence of Luke's journey—from his initial excitement to his triumphs while surfing. The way you highlighted his determination to keep trying, even after falling off, shows a good understanding of perseverance. On the flip side, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. For instance, ""urope"" should be ""Europe,"" ""definetally"" is ""definitely,"" and ""freind"" should be ""friend."" These mistakes can make your writing harder to read. Also, consider breaking up some longer sentences to enhance clarity.

When it comes to your argument about the different opinions on the trip, you introduced an interesting perspective. However, it would help to elaborate a bit more on why some people might have found the experience less enjoyable. This could give your essay more depth and help readers understand the contrast between Luke's experience and those of others. 

Looking at your writing ability overall, I can see that you have a good grasp of storytelling, but you need to refine your writing style. Your sentences often run on, which can make it challenging for readers to follow your thoughts. I recommend practicing writing shorter, more concise sentences. This will not only clarify your ideas but also make your writing more engaging. 

As you seem to have a keen interest in the topic of surfing and the adventures it brings, try to explore more about the surfing culture and what makes it special. You could also bring in more specific examples or anecdotes from the story to create a richer narrative. Additionally, working on your spelling and grammar will help you communicate your ideas more effectively. 

To enhance this essay, consider revising it by focusing on these areas. Start with a clear introduction that sets up what you’ll discuss, followed by organized paragraphs that each tackle a specific aspect of Luke's experience. Make sure to proofread your work for any spelling or grammatical errors before submitting. Keep writing, and I look forward to seeing your improvement!"

I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of seagoing, and it’s clear that you have a lot of interesting ideas. You’ve shared some personal experiences and insights that certainly make the essay engaging. However, the overall structure and clarity of your writing could use some improvement to better convey your message.

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you present the excitement and adventure involved in being a seagoing. You touch on various aspects of the lifestyle, from the places you can visit to the camaraderie you experience with others on board. However, your essay would benefit from clearer organization. Some of your sentences are a bit jumbled and can make it hard to follow your thoughts. For instance, the transitions between different ideas could be smoother, and there are several spelling and grammatical errors that can distract the reader from your main points.

When evaluating your argument, I think it’s great that you tried to highlight the opportunities and challenges of being a seagoing. You’ve included some personal anecdotes, like working with animals and playing games on board, which are effective in illustrating your points. However, to strengthen your argument, you might consider providing more specific examples or details about what makes these experiences special. For instance, instead of just saying you played games, you could describe a particular game or moment that was memorable.

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you have a genuine interest in the topic, which is fantastic. However, there are some weaknesses in your writing style, particularly with sentence structure and grammar. Taking some time to proofread your work would help catch mistakes like spelling errors and typos, such as ""toked"" instead of ""took"" and ""wached"" instead of ""watched."" Additionally, using more varied sentence structures could make your writing more engaging to read.

To enhance your essay, I recommend starting with a clear outline before you write. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure each paragraph flows logically into the next. Pay attention to your spelling and grammar—reading your essay out loud can help you catch errors you might not notice when reading silently. Lastly, consider diving deeper into your examples; adding more detail can really bring your experiences to life for the reader. Keep writing, and don’t be afraid to experiment with your style!"
M12,"The author supported his ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". He explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe he did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. He didnt just focus on one thing he focused on it all and he put his paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how he restated the question that he had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs he learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that he explained both bad and good thing about venus. He sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about and he knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

I appreciate the effort you put into this essay! You tackled a complex topic about Venus and presented both the positive and negative aspects, which is crucial when discussing such a nuanced subject. Your enthusiasm for the topic shines through, and it’s clear that you have an interest in the exploration of Venus. You did a good job of summarizing the author’s points, and your insights contribute to a well-rounded discussion.

There are definitely strengths in your writing. You showed a solid understanding of the author’s arguments and provided a balanced view of Venus. I particularly liked how you acknowledged the complexity of the topic by mentioning both the benefits and drawbacks. However, there are some areas that could use improvement. For one, the organization of your essay could be clearer. While you mentioned that the paragraphs were well-structured, some points felt a bit jumbled. More transitional phrases could help guide the reader through your thoughts. Additionally, be cautious of spelling and grammatical errors, such as ""explaning"" instead of ""explaining"" and ""puting"" instead of ""putting."" These small mistakes can distract from the overall quality of your work.

Your evaluation of the arguments presented in the essay is commendable. You referenced specific ideas, like Venus being referred to as Earth’s twin, which shows that you engaged with the material. However, to strengthen your argument, you might consider providing even more specific examples or details from the essay. This way, you’ll not only summarize but also analyze the points made by the author more deeply.

In terms of writing competency and style, you’re on the right track, but there are some areas that could really benefit from a bit more polish. Your voice is clear, and you express your thoughts with confidence, which is great! However, I’d encourage you to vary your sentence structure a bit more. Some sentences felt repetitive, which can make the reading experience less engaging. 

To develop further, focus on practicing your proofreading skills. Take a moment to read through your work before submitting it. This will help catch those small errors and improve clarity. Also, try to incorporate more examples or evidence to support your claims. This will not only strengthen your arguments but also show a deeper understanding of the topic. 

Overall, I think with some revisions and attention to detail, you can elevate this essay significantly. Keep up the good work and continue exploring your interest in Venus and other fascinating topics!"

I appreciate the effort you put into your essay about the Seagoing Cowboys program! You clearly have a passion for helping others, and it’s great to see how you’ve connected that passion to Luke Bomberger’s experiences. Your enthusiasm shines through, which is a strong aspect of your writing.

One of the strengths of your essay is the theme of community service and personal growth. You highlight the importance of helping others and the joy that can come from it. However, there are areas where you can improve. For instance, your essay would benefit from clearer organization. Some sentences feel a bit jumbled, which can make it hard for the reader to follow your ideas. Additionally, watch out for spelling and grammar mistakes, like ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and ""convensing"" instead of ""convincing."" These small errors can distract from your message.

In terms of your argument, you have a solid foundation, but it could be stronger with more specific examples. For instance, you mention that being a Seagoing Cowboy can help anyone in the community, but it would be even better if you could share a specific story or detail about how Luke or another participant made a difference. This would make your argument more compelling and relatable.

Your writing style shows potential, but there are some areas that could use refinement. You have a natural way of expressing your thoughts, but clarity is key. Sometimes, your sentences are a bit too long or complicated, which can confuse readers. Focus on breaking your ideas into shorter, clearer sentences. This will help your audience understand your points better.

You clearly care about the topic, which is fantastic! To improve, I recommend reading your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or errors. Also, consider outlining your main points before writing, which can help you stay organized. Lastly, don't hesitate to add more examples or personal anecdotes to enrich your writing. This will not only make your essay more engaging but also support your ideas more effectively.

Overall, you’re on the right track. Keep writing and refining your skills!"

Your essay presents a clear perspective on whether Luke should go on the trip to China, which is a great start! I appreciate that you’ve taken a stance and provided a few reasons to support it. Your writing shows that you have some ideas about the topic, and it’s clear you care about the outcome for Luke.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you attempted to present both sides of the argument, mentioning the good and bad reasons for going on the trip. This shows that you’re thinking critically about the situation. However, the essay does have some areas that could use improvement. For instance, the structure could be clearer with more distinct paragraphs, which would help the reader follow your thoughts more easily. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. Taking extra time to proofread would definitely help clarify your ideas.

When evaluating your argument and the examples you provided, I think you did a good job of touching on some important aspects, like exploration and learning. However, the reasons against the trip could use more depth. For instance, you mentioned that the ship could crash, but you didn’t explain why that would be a significant concern. Adding some context would strengthen your argument. It would also help to include more specific examples of what Luke might learn or experience on the trip to make your points more compelling.

Looking at your writing ability, you show promise with a clear voice, but there are definitely areas for growth. Your strengths lie in your ability to express your opinion and try to reason through your thoughts. However, I noticed some weaknesses in spelling, punctuation, and overall clarity. For instance, words like ""did't"" should be corrected to ""didn't,"" and ""enviorment"" should be ""environment."" These small errors can make your writing seem less polished.

To develop your writing skills further, I recommend focusing on a few key areas. Try to enhance your vocabulary by reading more diverse materials; this will help you express your ideas more effectively. Also, practice organizing your essays with clear sections and transitions. This could include starting each paragraph with a topic sentence that summarizes what you’ll discuss.

Incorporating feedback from peers or teachers before finalizing your work can also be beneficial. Consider reading your writing out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or mistakes. Lastly, because you seem interested in this topic, perhaps you could look into travel blogs or articles about cultural experiences to gather more inspiration and ideas for your essays. 

Keep working on your writing! You have a solid foundation, and with some more effort, you’ll only continue to improve."

First off, I want to acknowledge your effort in tackling a topic that holds historical significance. You've chosen a compelling story about someone’s journey post-World War II, and that’s a great starting point for engaging your readers. It’s clear you have an interest in this subject, and your passion shows through your writing. 

However, there are several areas where your essay could improve. The flow of your narrative feels a bit choppy at times, which can make it hard for readers to follow along. You also have a few spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity of your message. For example, words like ""freind,"" ""devistated,"" and ""odors"" should be corrected to ""friend,"" ""devastated,"" and ""orders,"" respectively. Additionally, using complete sentences and proper punctuation would help your writing come across as more polished.

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you highlight the importance of helping devastated countries after the war, which adds depth to your narrative. You also touch upon personal experiences that make the story relatable. However, it would enhance your argument if you provided more specific examples or details about the impact of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and how it directly assisted those in need. This could help ground your narrative and give it a more structured argument.

When it comes to your writing ability, it’s clear you have a foundational understanding of storytelling, but there’s room for growth. Your style shows potential, especially with your enthusiasm for the topic, but refining your grammar and sentence structure would make your writing more effective. A good strategy to improve would be to read your essay out loud to catch awkward phrasing or mistakes. You might also consider working on breaking your thoughts into clearer, more concise sentences. 

To elevate your essay, I would recommend revising it for clarity. Focus on organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs with a more defined introduction, body, and conclusion. Be sure to proofread for spelling and grammatical errors. Adding more specific examples about the UNRRA and the real-life impact of the missions could also strengthen your argument. Lastly, don’t shy away from sharing more about your character’s personal journey—what did he learn? How did he grow? This would make your essay even more engaging. Keep up the hard work; with these adjustments, I believe you can create a compelling piece!"

Your essay presents an interesting perspective on why Luke should join the program, but it feels a bit scattered and could benefit from more structure. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic, and it’s clear you have a strong connection to the idea of pursuing one's passions. However, the overall clarity of your argument is lacking, which makes it hard to follow your main points.

One of the strengths of your writing is the passion you display for Luke’s journey and choices. You emphasize her desire to be a Seagoing Cowgirl, which adds a personal touch to your essay. It's great to see how you connect her choices to her happiness and growth. However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors that can distract the reader and weaken your argument. Additionally, the amount of repetition in your points can make it feel redundant. Try to focus on developing your ideas more fully rather than reiterating the same thoughts.

Regarding your argument, the main idea that Luke should join the program because it could make her happy and help her grow is a solid foundation. However, you could strengthen your case by providing specific examples or evidence from the article or other sources that illustrate how this program could benefit her. Instead of saying ""this program might actually help her with something,"" try to specify what that something could be and why it's important to her. This will make your argument more persuasive.

In terms of writing competency and style, I see that you have a natural voice, which is a great asset. Your informal tone makes the essay relatable, but at times it feels too casual for an academic setting. To enhance your writing, focus on using clearer sentence structures and pay attention to spelling and grammar. For example, instead of ""Luke she is a good person,"" you could write, ""Luke is a good person,"" which is more straightforward.

One targeted recommendation is to take the time to outline your thoughts before writing. This can help you organize your ideas better and ensure that each paragraph flows into the next logically. Additionally, reading your essay aloud can help you catch awkward phrases or mistakes that you might not notice when reading silently. Finally, consider seeking feedback from peers or using writing resources to help you refine your grammar and style.

Overall, you have a strong foundation to build on, but focusing on clarity, structure, and specific examples will greatly improve your writing. Keep working on it, and I look forward to seeing how your ideas develop in future essays!"
M-F2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowgirl.This is why in paragraph 2 she said when she went over seas world war ll was begining, if she was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat she was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when she was on the boat she had an hourly role call acording to the story she fell and cracked her ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop her she would have went over board and eaten by a shark but she was fine she had to take a break for a couple of days. Why she should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowgirl is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if she keeps up what she is doing she will get really hurt do her job any more.

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

You’ve got a unique angle here, and it’s clear you have some interesting thoughts about why Luke shouldn’t be a sea-going cowgirl. That’s a great starting point! However, the essay feels a bit jumbled and lacks clarity in expressing those ideas. 

One of the strengths of your writing is that you’re tackling an engaging topic that can spark interest. The notion of the dangers of being a sea-going cowgirl during World War II has potential for a powerful narrative. However, your essay could use some clearer structure and organization. For example, the flow from one idea to the next is a bit choppy, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument. Additionally, there are quite a few spelling mistakes and grammatical issues, which distract from the points you’re trying to make. 

In terms of the argument itself, while you do present reasons for why Luke shouldn’t pursue this path, the examples you use could be stronger and more detailed. For instance, you mention her cracking ribs and the potential danger of being eaten by a shark, but these points come off as somewhat exaggerated and don't fully support your argument. Instead, try to focus on more concrete examples that showcase the risks involved in a more realistic light. 

When it comes to your writing ability, I see that you have a strong voice, but it needs some polishing. Your enthusiasm for the topic shows, which is fantastic! However, you need to pay more attention to sentence structure and grammar. There are several spelling mistakes, like ""acording"" and ""paragrah4,"" that can be easily fixed with a little proofreading. 

To improve your essay, I recommend starting with an outline to organize your thoughts more clearly. Make sure each paragraph has a clear main idea, and try to support your claims with specific examples. Pay attention to your spelling and grammar, perhaps using tools or asking someone to help proofread your work. Lastly, think about expanding on your ideas with more depth—what specific experiences could have contributed to Luke’s challenges? This will help bring your argument to life and make it more compelling. Keep writing! You have a solid foundation here, and with a bit of work, you can definitely enhance your essay."

Your essay brings up some interesting points about Luke and her experience in the Seagoing Cowgirls program. It’s clear you have a passion for this topic, and your enthusiasm really shines through. However, the essay could be more organized and polished to make your ideas clearer and more impactful.

One of the strengths of your writing is the personal connection you create with the subject. You express what you would enjoy about the program and how much you admire Luke’s dedication to her work with animals. However, I noticed several areas that could use improvement. For instance, there are quite a few grammatical errors, like misplaced apostrophes and run-on sentences, which can distract the reader from your main points. Additionally, the essay jumps around a bit, making it hard to follow your train of thought. Focusing on structure will help your readers understand your argument better.

When it comes to evaluating your argument, you present a compelling case for why Luke should return to the program, particularly highlighting her love for animals and the world travels. However, the essay lacks specific examples or details that could strengthen your argument. For instance, you mention her cracked ribs as a barrier but don’t delve into how that impacts her situation or what it means for her future. Adding these details would make your essay more engaging and convincing.

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a good foundation, but there are definitely places where your writing could be clearer. Your enthusiasm is evident, but you might benefit from slowing down a little and focusing on sentence structure. Sometimes, shorter sentences can help convey your ideas more clearly. 

One of your strengths is your ability to express your thoughts and feelings about the topic. However, a significant weakness is the need for more careful editing to catch those grammatical mistakes and run-on sentences. I recommend reading your essay out loud to help catch awkward phrasing and errors. 

To develop your writing further, consider taking the time to outline your main points before drafting. This way, you can create a logical flow for your ideas. Additionally, try to incorporate more specific examples and details to support your arguments. The more detail you add, the more your readers will connect with your ideas.

Keep working on your writing! You have a lot of potential, and with a bit more focus on structure and clarity, your essays can become even more compelling."

Your essay presents an interesting idea about a job that allows for adventure and excitement. I can see that you have a passion for the topic, and that enthusiasm comes through in your writing. However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved to make your argument clearer and more compelling.

One strength of your essay is the personal connection you have with the subject. It’s clear you feel strongly about this job, and that makes your writing engaging. On the other hand, there are several areas that need improvement. The organization of ideas is a bit chaotic, which makes it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts. Additionally, there are many spelling and grammar mistakes that distract from your message. Focusing on clarity and structure will help strengthen your writing overall.

When it comes to your argument, you seem to believe that this job is great because it provides enjoyment and a chance for adventure. However, your examples feel repetitive and lack detail. It might help to provide specific instances of what makes this job worthwhile—like what unique experiences someone might have or how it changes their life. Adding more depth to your examples can make your argument more convincing.

In terms of writing ability, you show a lot of potential, especially with your enthusiasm. However, there are clear areas for growth. Your writing style needs polishing, particularly in terms of grammar and spelling. For example, words like ""horses"" and ""across"" are misspelled, and sentences often run on without proper punctuation. To improve, try reading your work out loud to catch mistakes and to ensure that your sentences flow better. It might also be helpful to plan your ideas before writing. Outlining your thoughts can help you stay organized and make it easier for your reader to follow along.

Since you seem to have a genuine interest in the topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into why this job is appealing. Researching real-life examples or stories from people who have done this job could provide you with rich content to draw from. Also, consider discussing both the pros and cons, which can help create a more balanced perspective. Finally, take the time to proofread your work. It’s a small step that can make a big difference in how your ideas are received.

Overall, you have a solid foundation, but with some focused effort on structure, clarity, and detail, you can take your essay to the next level. Keep writing and refining your skills!"
M-F5,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

This essay presents an interesting perspective on the life of a seagoing cowgirl, and you clearly have a passion for the topic. The enthusiasm shines through as you discuss the adventures and experiences of the main character. It's great to see you connecting your thoughts to the broader message of encouraging young girls to pursue this unique path.

There are several strengths in your writing, particularly in the way you convey the excitement of the character's journey. The mention of specific places like Greece and China adds an engaging touch, and you highlight the fun aspects of life on board quite well. However, there are areas where you could make improvements. For example, some sentences are a bit unclear or contain spelling and grammatical errors, which can distract from your main points. Tightening up your structure and ensuring that your ideas flow smoothly would enhance readability.

Your argument could be stronger if you provided more detailed examples from the passage to support your claims. While you mention that the character had fun and traveled to various places, elaborating on how these experiences contributed to her overall message would deepen your analysis. Consider integrating quotes or specific anecdotes from the text to give your points more weight.

In terms of writing competency, you have a good foundation, but there are definitely areas for growth. Your style is conversational, which is engaging, but it could benefit from a bit more formality and clarity. Focus on constructing complete sentences and paying attention to punctuation and spelling—these small details matter a lot in creating a polished piece. 

As a student interested in this topic, try to delve deeper into the emotional and personal aspects of the character's experiences. Reflect on how her adventures shaped her perspective and what lessons she learned that could inspire others. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend revising for clarity and coherence. Make sure each paragraph flows logically into the next. Additionally, consider adding some quotes to strengthen your points about the character's experiences. Proofreading for spelling and grammar will also help elevate your writing, so take the time to review your work. Keep up the enthusiasm; it’s a great starting point for a compelling essay!"

One day luke was night watchman she had to check on all animals every hour one night she fell and almost landed in the sea but she cought.

First off, I want to say that it’s clear you put a lot of thought into this essay. The topic of being a seagoing cowgirl is intriguing and unique, and you’ve captured some of the excitement and challenges that come with it. Your writing shows enthusiasm, which is fantastic, but there are areas where clarity and organization could really help your message shine through.

One strength of your essay is the concept itself. The idea of Luke Bomberger as a seagoing cowgirl is compelling, and you touched on various activities that highlight both the fun and the hard work involved in that lifestyle. However, there are several areas that need improvement. For starters, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that can make it difficult to follow your thoughts. For instance, “grocrey” should be “grocery,” and “cought” should be “caught.” Additionally, some sentences feel fragmented or run-on, which can confuse the reader. Working on sentence structure and proofreading your work could make a huge difference.

In terms of your argument, while you’ve laid out some interesting points about Luke’s experiences, I feel like you could dive deeper into why these experiences matter. You mention the fun games and the hard work, but how did those shape Luke as a person? Also, the transition from her early life to her adventures at sea could be smoother. A little more detail on her motivations and emotions would really help bring her character to life. 

Your writing style has potential—there’s an engaging voice there—but honing your skills in clarity and coherence will make your essays even stronger. Try to focus on sentence variety and ensure each thought flows logically into the next. Additionally, consider expanding your vocabulary; this could help you express ideas more clearly and vividly.

Since it seems you have a genuine interest in the topic, I recommend doing a bit more research on the life of seagoing cowgirls or similar figures. This could provide you with more examples and inspire deeper insights. Also, before submitting, take the time to read your essay aloud. This will help you catch awkward phrases or errors you might have missed.

Overall, you have a solid foundation, but with a bit more attention to detail and structure, I believe your writing can really take off. Keep at it!"
M-F7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. If you read the passege, Luke says her life was changed and she had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities she visted. Some of things she visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things she did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things she did on board. She had to get water for the horses and feed them. She also had to be a nightwatch women.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowgirls is not a bad idea. She says that it changed her life and she got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because she did the program her decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

Your essay presents a good foundation for discussing the Seagoing Cowgirls program and why someone should consider joining. It captures some of the excitement and transformative experiences that participants might encounter, which is great! However, it feels a bit scattered at times, and some of your points could use more development and clarity.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you share specific experiences from Luke’s story, such as the cities she visited and activities on the ship. This helps paint a picture of what joining the program could be like. However, the essay is hampered by some spelling errors and grammatical issues that distract from your message. For example, ""exsperences"" should be ""experiences"" and ""abourd"" should be ""aboard."" These mistakes make it harder for the reader to focus on your ideas. Additionally, your argument could be more cohesive. You jump from experiences on the ship to the influence on future generations without fully connecting the dots.

When you evaluate Luke’s experiences, it would be beneficial to dive deeper into how those experiences changed her perspective or impacted her life. Instead of just stating that she had to perform chores, consider discussing how those tasks might have contributed to her growth or understanding of responsibility. You mention that her descendants loved to help poor countries, but it would strengthen your argument to elaborate on how participating in the program instilled those values. This would provide a clearer connection between the program and its long-term benefits.

Your writing style shows potential, but it would greatly benefit from more careful proofreading. Try reading your essay aloud to catch mistakes or awkward phrasing. This technique can help you identify areas that need clarity or improvement. Also, consider organizing your essay with clearer transitions between ideas. Each paragraph should build on the last, guiding the reader through your argument smoothly.

If you're interested in the Seagoing Cowgirls, think about what specifically draws you to the program. Maybe you could include a personal connection or a specific aspect you find inspiring. This would not only enrich your essay but also make your argument more compelling. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend revisiting your main points and ensuring they are well-supported with examples. Also, take the time to proofread for spelling and grammar errors. This will help you present your ideas more clearly and confidently. Keep pushing yourself to explore deeper connections and insights; your enthusiasm for the topic will shine through in your writing!"
M-F8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what she thinks about what she is doing,what she thinks about her friends, and what she thinks of helping others. But I bet she would think nice things about helping people because she saide that she liked the job. And when her friend asked her if she wanted to go with her she said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it she didnt want to miss. She also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and she also liked the journey geting to Europe with her friend. Plus we would of know what she thought about the journey,the place she was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what she thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what she thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how she felt when she craked her ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that she had with her new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what she felt and thought of it. Did she like it or not. And how about her family we would of know what she thought of them. Of course she would say good things about them but still we would of know more about her thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to her because it opened her world and changed her life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what she has now.","

Your essay shows a solid understanding of how changing the narrative perspective can affect the reader's connection to the character and the story. It’s great to see you exploring what a first-person narrative would reveal about Luke's thoughts and feelings. You have some interesting ideas about how the story could unfold and what insights we could gain from Luke's perspective.

One of the strengths of your essay is your enthusiasm for the topic. You clearly have a passion for understanding characters and their motivations. Your ability to identify key moments in the story, like Luke's feelings about helping others and her adventures, is commendable. However, there are areas where you could improve. For instance, your essay could benefit from clearer organization. It jumps around a bit, which can make it hard to follow your main points. Additionally, pay attention to spelling and grammar. Typos like “saide” instead of “said,” “geting” instead of “getting,” and “Acording” instead of “According” can distract from your message. 

In terms of your argument and examples, you do a good job of suggesting how a first-person perspective would enhance the reader's experience. However, to strengthen your argument, you might consider providing specific examples from the text to back up your claims. For instance, instead of just stating that Luke would think nice things about helping people, you could include a direct quote or a specific scene that illustrates her feelings. This would make your points more convincing and grounded in the text.

When it comes to your overall writing ability, you show promise! Your ideas are engaging and reflect a genuine interest in the story’s themes. However, there are some weaknesses, particularly in sentence structure and coherence. Many of your sentences are quite long and could be split into shorter, clearer statements. This would make your writing easier to follow and more impactful. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on organizing your thoughts more clearly before you write. Creating an outline could help you structure your ideas logically. Additionally, practice proofreading your work for spelling and grammar errors—reading aloud can sometimes help catch mistakes. Finally, try to incorporate more textual evidence into your essays. This will not only support your arguments but also demonstrate your understanding of the material.

Overall, you have a strong foundation to build on, and with some refinement in organization, grammar, and the use of examples, your writing can become even more effective. Keep up the hard work!"

Reading your essay about Luke Bomberger's experiences during World War II was quite an adventure! I appreciate the effort you put into telling her story, but there are quite a few areas where we can work together to improve your writing.

One of the strengths of your essay is the unique perspective you chose to explore—a cowgirl participating in World War II is not a common narrative! This creativity adds a lot of character to your writing. However, there are several areas that need attention. The essay feels a bit disjointed, which makes it difficult to follow Luke's journey clearly. Many sentences are a bit confusing due to grammatical mistakes, misspellings, and awkward phrasing. Clarifying your thoughts and organizing them more logically would enhance the overall flow.

When evaluating the argument and examples you presented, it seems like you're trying to share a compelling story about Luke's bravery and experiences. However, the way it's currently written makes it hard for the reader to grasp the significance of her actions. For instance, you mention her crossing oceans and her training but don't fully explain why these moments matter. Strengthening your examples and providing more context could help emphasize the themes of your essay.

In terms of writing competency and style, I can see you're passionate about the topic, which is fantastic! Your tone has a lively quality that brings energy to the narrative. However, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your message. Words like ""harley"" should be ""hardly,"" and ""discharded"" should be ""discharged."" These mistakes can confuse readers and distract from your story. 

To help you improve, I recommend focusing on a few key areas. First, try to outline your essay before you start writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your ideas flow logically from one to the next. Additionally, make use of spell-check features and proofread your work to catch those pesky errors. Finally, consider expanding on the important moments in your narrative—what did they mean for Luke, and how did they affect her journey?

Overall, you have a great foundation to build on. With some revisions and attention to detail, you can create a truly engaging and clear story about Luke Bomberger. I can't wait to see how you develop this piece further!"

I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the story ""A Cowgirl Who Rode Waves."" You clearly convey Luke’s journey from being unsure about surfing to ultimately loving the experience. Your narrative captures the excitement and challenges she faced, which is great to see. It’s wonderful to see your passion for the topic shine through!

One of the biggest strengths of your essay is the way you outline Luke’s feelings throughout her experiences. It's clear that you want to show the transformation she undergoes, which is a key aspect of storytelling. However, there are areas that need attention. For instance, the structure of your essay could be improved. It reads a bit like a list of events rather than a cohesive narrative. Adding more transitions between ideas would help your reader follow along more easily. Additionally, watch out for spelling and grammar errors, as they can distract from your message. Words like “definitely” and “experience” are misspelled, and there are some sentences that are a bit choppy. 

While you present Luke's experiences and opinions well, the essay could benefit from deeper insights into why some people didn’t enjoy the trip. Expanding on this would give your essay more depth and allow readers to see different perspectives. It’s important to present a balanced view, even if you disagree with those who had a different experience.

In terms of writing ability, I can see that you have a good grasp of the basic elements of storytelling, and your style is engaging. However, refining your sentence structure and expanding your vocabulary will help elevate your writing. I think you have a strong foundation, particularly since you seem genuinely interested in this topic. 

To develop your writing further, consider practicing your sentence variety. Instead of starting many sentences with “she,” try different structures to keep your writing fresh. Also, take time to proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Perhaps after writing your first draft, set it aside for a bit, then come back to it with fresh eyes to catch any mistakes. 

Overall, you have a lot of potential here, and I can’t wait to see how your writing evolves in the future! Keep working on these suggestions, and your essays will become even more compelling."
M-F11,"She's convincing people to be a seagoing by saying you can go to nice places. She said that one time she went to a place with streets of water. She also said it is an opportunity of a lifetime to be a seagoing. She is saying you should join the seagoings, becouse it is very nice to go to places all the way from the other side of the U.S.

She's also saying if you like taking care of animals then you should join. She talks about how her ant and her worked on a farm so that helped her out of taking care of animals, but then she says that it did not help her with the dangers of the sea. She also talks about how she gets she's ribs broken. She also says that you work for them you sometimes have to check on the animals hourly.

She tells you that her friend tolled her that she should work there, so she could not say no, because she knew it would be a life time opportunity. She tells you she would find her self having fun on borad, especially on the return trips after they droped off the anamals. She says she play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

Your essay gives a decent overview of the experience of being a seagoing. I can see that you’re passionate about the topic, which is a great start! You’ve shared some interesting points about the adventures and challenges that come with the job. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization and more detailed explanations to support your arguments.

One of the strengths of your writing is the enthusiasm you have for the subject. You clearly convey a sense of excitement about the places you've been and the experiences you've had. However, there are areas where you can improve. For instance, some sentences are a bit confusing, and there are several spelling and grammatical errors that make it harder to follow your thoughts. Working on sentence structure and grammar will help your ideas shine through more clearly.

Your argument about the benefits of being a seagoing is a good one, but it could be strengthened with more specific examples. You mention the exciting activities on board, like playing baseball and caring for animals, but you could delve deeper into how these experiences impacted you or others. Explaining more about the work involved and the feelings tied to those experiences would make your argument more convincing.

In terms of writing competency, I see potential in your style. You have a unique voice, but at times it feels a bit choppy. Strengths include your ability to describe various activities and the excitement they bring. However, clarity is a weakness right now. There are moments where spelling errors like ""borad"" instead of ""board"" and ""toked"" instead of ""took"" could distract from your message. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend reading more essays or stories about travel or adventure, which can help you see how other writers structure their ideas. You might also try writing shorter paragraphs that focus on single ideas to make your writing flow better. Lastly, don’t forget to proofread your work or ask someone else to help catch those pesky errors before you submit.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for being a seagoing, and I encourage you to keep writing. With a little more focus on clarity and example depth, your essays can truly shine!"
M-F12,"The author supported her ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". She explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe she did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. She didnt just focus on one thing she focused on it all and she put her paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how she restated the question that she had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs she learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that she explained both bad and good thing about venus. She sounded like she knew exactly what she was talking about and she knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

Your essay presents some interesting ideas about Venus, and it’s clear that you have engaged with the topic. I appreciate how you highlighted both the positive and negative aspects of Venus, showing that you understand the complexity of the subject. However, the writing could use some refinement to enhance clarity and coherence.

One of the strengths of your essay is your balanced approach. You didn’t just focus on the dangers of Venus or its potential; you managed to cover both sides, which is essential for a well-rounded argument. Your conclusion, where you tied back to the initial question, was a strong element that helped unify your thoughts. However, your essay would benefit significantly from clearer organization and smoother transitions between ideas. Some sentences felt a bit jumbled, and there were a few typos and grammatical errors that distracted from your message.

When you evaluate arguments and examples, it’s good to see that you referenced specific points, like NASA’s interest in Venus. However, it would be even better if you could elaborate more on these points. Why is Venus referred to as Earth's ""twin""? What are the specific dangers and benefits you see? Providing more detail and explanation would strengthen your argument and help readers understand your perspective better.

In terms of writing competency, your enthusiasm for the topic shines through, which is fantastic! However, your style could be more polished. There are some spelling and grammatical issues, such as ""explaning"" instead of ""explaining"" and ""puting"" instead of ""putting,"" which can detract from your credibility as a writer. Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure more; many of your sentences have a similar rhythm, which can make the writing feel monotonous.

Since you seem genuinely interested in this topic, I recommend reading more about Venus and perhaps incorporating some more scientific sources or data to back up your claims. Expanding your vocabulary and practicing sentence variety could also enhance your writing style. Lastly, always proofread your work before submission to catch any typos or unclear phrasing. 

Keep working on these areas, and I’m sure you’ll see improvement in your writing. Your enthusiasm for the subject is a great foundation to build on!"

I appreciate the effort you put into your essay about being a Seagoing Cowgirl! It's clear you have a personal connection to the topic, and your enthusiasm shines through. You've taken on a meaningful subject about helping others, which is very commendable.

One of the strengths of your essay is the passion you express for the Seagoing Cowgirls program. You highlight how it has made a difference in Luke Bomberger’s life, and that personal touch is important. It’s great that you recognize the fun aspect of the program while also emphasizing the value of helping others. However, I noticed some areas that could use a bit of polishing. Your ideas could be better organized to create a smoother flow for the reader. Some sentences are a bit unclear or contain spelling mistakes, which distracts from your main points. For example, ""convensing"" should be ""convincing,"" and ""greatfull"" should be ""grateful."" Taking the time to proofread your work could help you catch those errors.

When it comes to your argument, you touched on some solid points about community involvement and personal fulfillment. It would enhance your essay if you included specific examples of activities or experiences from the Seagoing Cowgirls program that illustrate how helping others can create a sense of community. This would not only strengthen your argument but also provide your readers with a clearer picture of what it means to be a Seagoing Cowgirl.

Your writing style shows promise, but there are aspects that need attention. Your sentences sometimes lack clarity, making it a bit challenging to follow your thoughts. I encourage you to break down your ideas into smaller sections and use more varied sentence structures. This will help keep your readers engaged! 

You have a great foundation to build on, and with some focused revisions, your essay can be even stronger. Consider drafting an outline before writing to help organize your thoughts. After writing, take a moment to read through your work out loud; this can help you catch any awkward phrasing or errors. Lastly, don’t hesitate to ask for feedback from peers or teachers before submitting your final draft. 

Keep up the good work, and I’m looking forward to seeing how you grow as a writer!"

Your essay touches on an interesting topic, and I appreciate your effort to argue why Luke should go on the trip. It shows that you have thought about the decision-making process and the implications of travel. However, your writing could benefit from clearer organization and more detailed reasoning.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you clearly state your opinion on why Luke should go on the trip, which is essential for persuasive writing. You raise some valid points about exploration and learning, which adds depth to your argument. However, the essay would be much stronger if you provided more specific reasons and examples. For instance, explain what Luke might discover in China or how this trip could impact her life positively. Additionally, your essay contains several grammatical errors and typos that make it harder to read, so careful proofreading would help a lot.

In terms of your argument, you've got a good start with the pros and cons of going on the trip. However, the negative points you mention, like the ship crashing or running out of food, could use more elaboration. Instead of just listing potential dangers, consider discussing how these risks are outweighed by the benefits of the trip. This would create a more balanced argument and strengthen your case for why Luke should go.

When it comes to your writing style, you’ve got a conversational tone that makes the essay relatable. But, there are areas where clarity is lacking—like the structure of your sentences. Watch out for run-on sentences and make sure to check your spelling, especially with words like ""exist"" and ""environment."" These little details can greatly improve the overall flow of your writing.

Since you seem interested in travel and adventure, try to channel that enthusiasm into your writing. Consider what you would want to learn or experience in a new place and infuse that into your essay. To enhance your writing, I’d recommend drafting an outline before you start writing. This can help you organize your thoughts and ensure that each paragraph supports your main argument effectively. Also, take the time to revise your work after writing—reading it out loud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing.

Overall, your essay has a good foundation, and with some revisions and more detailed examples, it can become much stronger. Keep practicing, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas in the future!"

","I would rate your essay a 2 out of 5. 

Let’s dive into your overall impression. You’ve chosen an interesting topic that connects with a significant historical moment, which is fantastic. It’s clear you’re passionate about the subject, and your enthusiasm shines through in your writing. However, the essay feels a bit disorganized and has several grammatical errors that distract from your message. 

In terms of strengths, your idea of discussing the work done after World War II to help devastated countries is quite compelling. You also provide some engaging imagery, especially when describing your experiences on the boat. However, there are areas that need improvement. The essay lacks clear structure, making it hard to follow your main points. Additionally, spelling and grammatical mistakes (like ""losing"" instead of ""losed"" and ""countries"" instead of ""counteries"") make it difficult to understand your ideas fully. 

When it comes to the argument and examples you use, the story of your experience is a good starting point, but it could use more depth. You mention the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which is a crucial part of the narrative, but you don’t elaborate on what that organization did or why it was significant. More context would strengthen your argument and help readers appreciate the impact of your work.

Looking at your writing ability, I see potential. Your voice is engaging, and you clearly have a strong interest in the topic. That said, your writing style could benefit from more clarity and coherence. You often jump from one idea to another without smooth transitions, which can confuse readers. 

To improve, I recommend focusing on organizing your essay better. Try outlining your main points before you start writing. This will help you create a clearer flow for your ideas. Additionally, pay close attention to spelling and grammar. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. 

Since you seem interested in this topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into the historical context. Research the UNRRA and include more details about its mission and impact. This will not only strengthen your argument but also provide a richer experience for your readers. 

Keep writing and refining your skills! You have a great foundation, and with some focused effort, I’m sure you can elevate your work to the next level."

Your essay has some interesting ideas, but it feels a bit jumbled and could use more clarity and structure. I appreciate your attempt to delve into the emotions behind the Mona Lisa's expression, and it's clear you have some thoughts about what the painting conveys. However, the writing could be refined to clearly express those thoughts and make a more compelling case.

One strength of your essay is your interpretation of Mona Lisa's expression. You offer a unique perspective by describing her smile as a mix of happiness and indifference, which is intriguing. You also attempt to connect the background to her emotions, suggesting a thoughtful setting that reflects her inner state. However, the essay lacks organization, making it difficult for the reader to follow your argument. There are also numerous grammatical errors, and some sentences are quite run-on, which detracts from your message. 

Your argument about the painting's colors being muted seems to suggest a deeper meaning, but it feels a bit underdeveloped. While you mention the difference between the real Mona Lisa and what you've seen, you could strengthen your argument by incorporating more specific examples or details. For instance, discussing the techniques Da Vinci used could provide a richer context and help reinforce your points about the painting's emotional depth.

When it comes to your writing ability, it appears you have a foundation of ideas, but the execution needs significant work. The style tends to be informal and casual, which can be engaging but sometimes lacks the precision needed for art analysis. Pay attention to sentence structure—some of your sentences are quite long and could be broken down into clearer, more concise statements. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on organization. Start with a clear introduction that outlines your main points, and then structure each paragraph around one central idea. This will make your essay easier to follow. Additionally, take the time to proofread for grammar and punctuation errors before submitting your work to ensure your ideas come across clearly. 

Consider reading more about art criticism to familiarize yourself with common analytical frameworks. This could help you formulate your thoughts and present them more effectively. Engaging with different perspectives on the Mona Lisa could also enhance your understanding and provide fresh insights for your writing. Keep exploring your thoughts on this fascinating topic!"
F2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. She did not want to smile for the camra and so she did not she had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because she could not smile, she did not want to. That was the case she did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give her a smile. So they came up with a way and got her a smile for the photo and now she is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that she would just smile but she would not have it and so they had to give her a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want her smile so they made a program and copywrited her smile and made it fake. Like they said ""she was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. Her emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci her emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then she would be missing on things on her face.

First off, it’s clear that you have a passion for the subject of the Mona Lisa and the technology that can alter her expression. Your essay tackles an intriguing idea about how emotions in art can be interpreted and manipulated through technology, and that’s a fascinating angle to explore. However, the writing needs some refinement to better convey your thoughts.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you’re engaging with a modern twist on a classic piece of art. This is a unique approach that not many people consider, and it shows your interest in blending art with technology. However, the essay’s clarity and organization could use improvement. There are quite a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that make it hard to follow your ideas. For instance, phrases like “the most best masterpiece the painting of centery” need to be reworked for clarity. Try to focus on expressing your thoughts in a more straightforward way, and remember to proofread for spelling and grammar.

Your argument about the impact of technology on the Mona Lisa’s smile is an interesting one, but it could be strengthened with clearer examples and a more structured approach. You mention Thomas Huang’s software, which is great, but it would help to explain exactly how this technology works in relation to your main point. Additionally, the statistics about her emotions feel somewhat disjointed from the main argument. Instead of listing percentages, consider integrating these details more naturally into your discussion. 

In terms of writing competency, you have a lot of ideas, which is fantastic! However, the execution needs more attention. There are some notable weaknesses in grammar and sentence structure that can distract from your message. Focus on using correct spelling and punctuation, and try to break down your thoughts into clearer sentences. 

As you continue working on your writing, I recommend reading your essay out loud. This can help you catch awkward phrases and improve the flow of your writing. Also, consider outlining your main points before you start writing, which can help you maintain a clear structure throughout your essay. Engaging with more examples from art history or technology could also help strengthen your argument and provide context for your readers. Keep exploring this interesting intersection of art and technology, and don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it!"
F3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

Your essay presents an interesting perspective on the Mona Lisa and challenges the commonly accepted interpretations of her emotions. It’s clear that you have a passion for the subject matter, and your personal take on the painting adds a unique flavor to your argument. However, the overall structure and clarity of your essay could use some refinement to make your points more effective.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you question the accuracy of the emotional analysis attributed to the Mona Lisa. This shows critical thinking and a willingness to engage with the topic on a deeper level. You also mention facial feedback theory, which adds another layer to your argument. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization and more precise language. Some sentences feel run-on or lack punctuation, which can make it hard for readers to follow your thoughts. Try breaking down longer sentences into shorter, more digestible ones, and ensure that each idea flows logically into the next.

In terms of your argument and the examples you provided, you have some good points, especially regarding the limitations of interpreting emotions based solely on facial expressions. While you do mention the lack of eyebrows and its impact on emotional reading, your argument could be strengthened by incorporating more concrete examples or references to other artworks or studies that support your claims. Additionally, your conclusion could tie back to your main argument more clearly, reinforcing the idea that interpreting emotions from a static image is inherently subjective.

When it comes to your writing ability, it's evident that you have a strong voice, but there are some areas that need attention. The casual tone is engaging, but clearer diction and grammatical accuracy will enhance your credibility. Pay attention to spelling mistakes, such as ""expiriencing"" and ""dissapointed,"" and make sure to proofread your work. These errors can detract from your overall message. Also, consider varying your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged.

Since you seem to have a genuine interest in the topic, I recommend diving deeper into research about emotional expression in art. This could give you more context and examples to bolster your arguments. Reading more about art criticism and emotional theory could also provide you with a broader vocabulary and more sophisticated ways to articulate your points. Finally, practice writing conclusions that effectively summarize your main arguments and reinforce your thesis to leave a lasting impression on your readers.

To elevate your essay, focus on clarifying your main points and addressing grammatical issues. Consider drafting an outline before writing to organize your thoughts and ensure a logical flow. This will help you build a stronger case for your perspective on the Mona Lisa. Keep exploring this fascinating topic; you have the potential to develop a compelling argument with a bit more refinement!"

When reading your essay, I can see that you have a strong opinion about the Facial Coding System and how it fails to accurately convey human emotions. It's clear that you feel passionately about this topic, which is great! Your unique perspective encourages readers to think critically about the limitations of technology in understanding emotions. However, the way you expressed your ideas could use some refinement to enhance clarity and impact.

One of the strengths of your writing is your ability to convey your point of view. You present a clear stance that technology might not be the best way to understand feelings. However, there are several areas where you can improve. For instance, the essay would benefit from better organization. Breaking your thoughts into distinct paragraphs could help guide your reader through your argument more effectively. Additionally, watch for grammar and spelling errors, as these can distract from your message. Phrases like ""two perent"" and ""andd"" can take away from the professionalism of your work. 

In terms of your argument, you provide personal insights and a reference to the Mona Lisa, which adds an interesting layer to your essay. However, to strengthen your argument, it would be helpful to include more specific examples or studies that support your point. Rather than just stating your belief, citing research or expert opinions could lend more credibility to your claims. This way, you can show why the Facial Coding System may not be reliable instead of just saying that it isn’t.

Looking at your overall writing ability, I see potential. You have a solid grasp of your ideas, but your writing style could be more polished. Strengths include your clear viewpoint and ability to express what you believe. However, the weaknesses lie in the structure, grammar, and the need for more concrete examples to back up your arguments effectively. 

As someone interested in the topic of facial coding and emotions, I recommend diving a bit deeper into research. Try to find articles or studies that challenge your viewpoint or provide evidence to support it. This will not only strengthen your argument but also broaden your understanding of the subject. Additionally, practicing your writing by outlining your essays beforehand can help you organize your thoughts better. 

To enhance your essay, consider revising it with these tips in mind. Start by breaking it down into clear sections: an introduction, body paragraphs for each main point, and a conclusion. Focus on clarity; make sure each sentence contributes to your overall argument. Lastly, proofreading your work for grammatical errors and ensuring your ideas flow logically will make a significant difference. Keep up the passion for your topic, and I look forward to seeing how your writing develops!"

Your essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the challenges and solutions related to studying Venus, which is impressive. You clearly understand the complexities of the topic, and your engagement with the material shows that you are genuinely interested in the subject matter. The way you break down the author’s arguments and present them in your own words demonstrates a solid grasp of the essay’s content.

One of the strengths of your writing is your ability to summarize key points clearly. You did a great job of identifying the main problems that Venus presents, along with the potential solutions that NASA is exploring. However, there are areas where your writing could be improved. For instance, some sentences feel a bit awkward or repetitive, which can distract from your overall argument. It would help to vary your sentence structure and avoid restating ideas unnecessarily. Additionally, integrating your own analysis or perspective on the importance of these solutions could add depth to your argument.

Your evaluation of the author’s argument is well done, and you effectively highlight how she supports her claim with both problems and solutions. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the implications of these challenges and solutions. For example, how might the successful exploration of Venus impact our understanding of other planets or our approach to space exploration in general? Adding such reflections could strengthen your argument and engage your reader more fully.

In terms of writing style, you have a solid foundation, but there is room for refinement. Your use of transitional phrases and clearer connections between your ideas could improve the flow of your essay. Also, watch for minor errors, like typos (""milles"" should be ""miles"" and ""counditions"" should be ""conditions""), which can detract from your credibility as a writer. 

Since you seem to have a genuine interest in this topic, try to harness that passion to expand your analysis further. Consider researching more about the potential benefits of studying Venus beyond the immediate challenges. This could provide you with additional insights to incorporate into your essay. 

Overall, you have a commendable grasp of the subject and a clear structure in your writing. With some revisions and deeper analysis, your essay could be even more compelling. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas further!"

Your essay presents an interesting take on the topic of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile Again,"" but there are areas that need some work to really strengthen your argument and clarity. 

It’s clear that you’re passionate about the subject, which is a great foundation to start from. You’ve chosen a captivating theme that could engage readers, and it’s evident that you understand the significance of the Mona Lisa and its representations. However, the essay feels a bit disjointed at times, making it hard for the reader to follow your main points. The organization could be improved to ensure that each paragraph flows logically into the next. 

One of your strengths is your ability to touch on specific details about the painting and the emotions it conveys. However, some of your ideas seem underdeveloped. For instance, when you mention the differences between the original and the computer-generated image, it would be helpful to elaborate on why those changes matter or how they change our perception of Mona Lisa. Additionally, some sentences are a bit confusing due to grammar and word choice. For example, phrases like ""for accomplishing the process of the model of a great model"" could be clearer. 

In terms of your writing style, you show promise, but clarity is key. Your enthusiasm is great, but it’s important to express your ideas more clearly so your reader can easily understand your points. Pay attention to sentence structure and try to avoid overly complex phrases that could confuse your audience. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend that you start by outlining your main ideas before writing. This will help you organize your thoughts better and ensure that each paragraph has a clear purpose. Focus more on developing your arguments with examples and analysis. For instance, you might want to explore how the Mona Lisa's smile has been interpreted throughout history and how that contrasts with the new image you’re discussing.

She have many emotions in her face, can be change her smile.

I appreciate your effort in tackling a fascinating topic that combines emotion recognition and technology. It’s clear you have a genuine interest in the subject, and that enthusiasm shines through your writing. However, the essay could benefit from more clarity and organization to effectively communicate your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is the selection of an engaging example—Mona Lisa's smile is a brilliant choice to illustrate how facial expressions can convey different emotions. You grasp the concept of machines interpreting human emotions, which is central to your argument. However, your writing has several areas that need improvement. There are numerous grammatical errors, such as sentence structure issues and misspellings, which can distract the reader from your main points. Additionally, the flow of your essay feels a bit choppy at times, making it difficult to follow your argument seamlessly.

Your argument about how computers can distinguish between real and fake smiles is intriguing, but it would be stronger with more detail and evidence. While you mention the universal aspects of facial expressions, elaborating on this idea could deepen your argument. Consider including more specific examples or research that supports your claims about technology's capabilities in this area. Also, be cautious about generalizations; rather than saying “the computers now can check one smile,” it might be more accurate to specify how they analyze various facial cues to understand emotions better.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a good understanding of the topic, but the execution needs refinement. Your voice comes through, which is great, but working on grammar and sentence structure will make your ideas clearer. 

One strength is your choice of topic and the passion you demonstrate. Yet, the weaknesses lie in the clarity of your writing and the details of your argument. I recommend focusing on sentence structure and ensuring that your ideas flow logically from one to the next. Proofreading your work for grammatical errors and considering how to expand on your examples will also help. You might find it useful to read your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing or unclear sentences.

As someone who is interested in this topic, I encourage you to delve deeper into the research surrounding emotion recognition technology. This could provide you with additional insights and examples to enhance your argument. Engaging with more academic or professional sources could also help strengthen your essay. Overall, with some revisions and attention to detail, your writing can effectively convey your interesting ideas about this cutting-edge technology."

Hey there! Thanks for sharing your essay about the mask on Mars. It’s a really intriguing topic, and I can see you put some thought into it. Let’s dive into what I think about your work.

First off, I appreciate your creativity and the way you brought your own thoughts into the discussion. The back-and-forth between you and Christina really adds a personal touch and makes the narrative engaging. It’s clear you’re interested in this subject, and your passion shines through. However, there are some areas that could use a little polishing. For instance, the organization of your ideas could be clearer. Jumping between different thoughts makes it a bit hard to follow your argument. A more structured approach, where you clearly introduce your ideas and then support them, would really help your readers.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you included references to external sources, like NASA's image release. This adds credibility to your argument. However, it would be even stronger if you explained why those references are significant to your point. For example, when you mention NASA’s caption about the rock formation, consider elaborating on how that contrasts with Christina's beliefs. You want to make sure your examples directly support your main argument.

In terms of writing ability, you’ve got a good foundation, but there are quite a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that can distract from your message. Phrases like “me and my partner” should be “my partner and I,” and “Christina thought different” could be better expressed as “Christina had a different thought.” Focusing on these small details can greatly enhance your overall clarity and professionalism. 

If you're really interested in this topic, consider reading more about Mars and how scientists analyze images from space. This will not only help you with factual accuracy but also give you more depth to your arguments. Additionally, practice writing more structured essays. You might find it helpful to outline your ideas before writing. This way, you can see where the flow might be unclear and adjust accordingly. 

Overall, I can see you’re on the right track, and with some focused revisions, your essay can become even more compelling. Keep exploring your interests, and don’t hesitate to reach out for more help as you refine your writing!"
F9,"I need a car! why wont you get me a car? all of my friends have cars but me, why won't you get me a car!

Overall, I can see you put a lot of thought into this essay, especially considering how you feel about the topic of cars and their impact on the environment. Your enthusiasm comes through, which is great! However, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure and some refinement in your writing. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your personal connection to the topic. Sharing your experiences and feelings about wanting a car adds a relatable touch, and it helps to illustrate your point. However, there are several areas for improvement, particularly regarding grammar, spelling, and clarity. For instance, there are several typos and grammatical errors, such as ""briving"" instead of ""driving"" and ""are"" in place of ""our."" These mistakes can distract from your argument and make it harder for readers to follow your thoughts. 

When evaluating your argument, I appreciate how you incorporated different sources to back up your points about car usage and environmental concerns. However, it would be stronger if you explained those sources a bit more clearly and connected them to your personal narrative. For example, rather than just stating facts, take a moment to reflect on how those facts impact your own life or the lives of those around you. This will create a more cohesive argument.

In terms of writing competency and style, I see potential in your voice, but your essay could benefit from clearer organization. The flow of your ideas feels a bit jumbled at times, which makes it difficult to follow your main points. Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. Right now, some sentences come off as run-on or overly complicated.

As a student interested in the topic of cars and their impact, I encourage you to delve deeper into your research and present your findings in a more structured way. Try to outline your main points before writing, making sure each paragraph has a clear focus. This will help guide your reader through your argument. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest proofreading carefully for spelling and grammatical errors. You might also want to read your essay out loud to catch awkward phrases or sentences that don’t flow well. Finally, try to add more of your own insights and reflections on the facts you present, connecting them back to your personal experiences. This will not only strengthen your argument but also make your writing more engaging. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas further!"

Your essay brings up critical issues surrounding vehicle use and carbon emissions, which is a timely and relevant topic. I appreciate your passion for the environment and your desire to make a difference. However, there are areas where your writing could be clearer and more structured, which would strengthen your argument.

One of the standout qualities of your essay is your enthusiasm for the subject matter. You clearly care about the environment and want to encourage others to take action, which is great! However, some of your ideas could benefit from a bit more organization and clarity. For instance, your thoughts on banning cars on certain days are interesting, but you might want to elaborate on how this would be enforced and what the repercussions would look like. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammar issues that distract from your message, such as ""vehical,"" ""artical,"" and ""emmisons."" Paying attention to these details will help your essay be more polished and effective.

In terms of argumentation, you have a solid foundation. You present clear points about reducing carbon emissions and suggest practical alternatives, like biking and carpooling. However, it would strengthen your argument if you included more specific examples or data to support your claims. For instance, referencing studies or statistics about the impact of vehicle emissions on climate change could provide more weight to your argument. It would also help to anticipate counterarguments—what do people who strongly rely on cars say, and how could you address those concerns?

Your writing shows a strong interest in this topic, which is wonderful! To take your writing to the next level, focus on improving your sentence structure and grammar. Read your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or typos, and consider revising for clarity. Additionally, you might want to explore more about the social implications of reducing vehicle use—how would communities react? What are some success stories from cities that have implemented similar measures? Engaging with these questions could offer a richer perspective.

Overall, your essay has the potential to be a compelling piece advocating for environmental responsibility. Keep refining your ideas, working on your writing mechanics, and exploring the nuances of your argument. You're on the right track!"

Overall, your essay presents a passionate viewpoint about the relevance of understanding emotions tied to historical figures or art. I can see that you have strong feelings about this topic, and it's great that you're willing to express them. However, the way these ideas are conveyed could be clearer and more structured. Right now, your thoughts come off as a bit jumbled, which might confuse readers rather than engage them.

In terms of strengths, your voice comes through strongly, and it's clear you’re not afraid to express your frustration. This adds a personal touch that can be impactful. However, the primary area for improvement lies in organization. Your ideas jump around quite a bit, making it difficult for the reader to follow your train of thought. It would help if you laid out your main points more systematically. 

When it comes to your argument, it feels like you’re making a valid point about the irrelevance of historical emotions, but it lacks depth and clear examples to support your claims. For instance, referencing specific artworks or figures could help ground your argument. You mentioned the Mona Lisa—exploring her context or the artist’s intent could provide a more robust discussion. 

Regarding your writing ability, you have a strong voice, which is a valuable skill. However, there are some weaknesses in clarity and grammar that need attention. There are several misspellings and grammatical errors that distract from your message. Focusing on sentence structure and punctuation will help your ideas shine through more clearly. 

Since it seems like you’re interested in this topic, I recommend taking a step back and planning your essay before diving in. Outline your main points, and think about how you want to structure your argument. Also, consider revising for clarity—reading your essay out loud can help you catch places where your thoughts might be muddled. And don’t hesitate to use examples to back up your points; they can really strengthen your writing. 

Overall, I appreciate your passion, but with some revisions and a bit more focus, you can turn this into a compelling piece!"
F12,"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent woman. we all kmow she was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked her if she was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show her emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it.

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent woman. we all kmow she was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked her if she was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion.

Reading your essay was an interesting experience, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic! It's clear you have a passion for exploring how technology can help us understand emotions better, especially in the context of the Mona Lisa. However, there are several areas where your writing could be clearer and more structured to effectively convey your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your engagement with the subject matter. You’ve made an effort to connect technology, emotions, and art—a unique combination that shows your thinking outside the box. You also express a sense of empathy toward the Mona Lisa, which adds a personal touch to your argument. However, there are many spelling and grammatical errors that can distract the reader. For example, words like ""technology"" and ""reason"" were misspelled. Additionally, your sentences could benefit from clearer structure and punctuation to help with readability. 

In terms of your argument, you presented some intriguing points about how technology can help reveal hidden emotions. However, your ideas could be more convincing if they were organized in a clearer manner. For instance, you jump from discussing the Mona Lisa's emotions to technology without a smooth transition. It would be helpful to elaborate on how understanding emotions can impact our interactions with others, possibly with more specific examples. Furthermore, providing a clearer explanation of the ""action units"" and how they relate to the Mona Lisa would strengthen your argument.

Your writing shows potential, but it also shows that you're still developing some fundamental skills. The way you express your thoughts is engaging, but clarity is essential in academic writing. Your use of informal language and some run-on sentences can confuse the reader. Focus on writing complete sentences and using proper punctuation to make your points clearer. 

Since you seem to have a genuine interest in emotions and technology, I recommend reading more essays or articles on these topics. Pay attention to how they are structured, and try to replicate that organization in your own writing. Additionally, consider practicing your proofreading skills. After you finish writing, take the time to read through your work to catch any errors. It can make a significant difference!

Overall, you’re on a great path with your interest and ideas, but refining your writing skills will help you express them more effectively. I’m looking forward to seeing how you grow as a writer!"

First off, I appreciate your passion for the topic of limiting car use and its impact on the environment. It’s clear that you care about making a positive change, which is a great starting point for any essay. Your enthusiasm shines through, and the personal touch with the example from Germany adds a nice layer to your argument. 

However, there are several areas where the essay could be improved. One major issue is clarity. Some sentences need rephrasing for better readability, and there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your overall message. For instance, ""monther"" should be ""mother,"" and ""amense"" should be ""immense."" These small mistakes can distract your reader from the important points you're trying to make. Additionally, your introduction could be clearer about the main argument you’re going to present.

In terms of your argument, you’ve made a good start by linking car use to environmental issues, but it could be more structured. The transition from discussing cars to people's choices about walking and public transportation feels a bit abrupt. It would help to explain why people might resist these changes and counter those objections with stronger reasoning or evidence. The mention of a town that banned cars is intriguing, but it would be more effective if you provided more detail about how that decision impacted the community. 

Your writing style shows potential, but it can be refined. You have a conversational tone that makes the essay engaging, but sometimes that leads to informal word choices and sentence fragments. For instance, when you say, “Can you do that?” it feels out of place in an academic essay. Strengths include your ability to connect emotionally with the reader and your clear concern for environmental issues. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on organization. Try outlining your essay before you start writing to ensure that your ideas flow logically. Also, pay attention to grammar and spelling; tools like spell check or grammar check can be very helpful. Lastly, consider diving deeper into examples or case studies to strengthen your argument. Perhaps research a specific city or community that has successfully limited car use and highlight the benefits they’ve seen.

Overall, you have a solid foundation with your ideas, but refining your writing and structuring your arguments more clearly will greatly enhance your essay. Keep working on this, and I’m excited to see how your writing evolves!"

First off, I appreciate you tackling such a thought-provoking topic about technology and emotions. It’s clear you have a personal stake in this subject, and that passion comes through in your writing. You bring up an important point about the potential risks of new technologies that try to analyze or manipulate our emotions. It’s a complex issue, and your willingness to engage with it is commendable.

However, there are some areas where your essay could be stronger. The writing has quite a few spelling and grammatical errors, which can make it hard for readers to follow your ideas. For instance, words like ""technologie,"" ""probabaly,"" and ""no"" should be corrected to ""technology,"" ""probably,"" and ""know."" These small mistakes can distract from your main message, so spending some time proofreading or using tools to help with grammar would be beneficial.

When it comes to your argument, I see that you’re trying to express a strong opinion about the emotional implications of technology. However, your claims could be supported more effectively with clearer explanations and examples. You mention an article, but it would help if you provided a bit more context about what it says and how it connects to your argument. Instead of saying “I got that out the article,” try to summarize the article’s main point and elaborate on how it relates to your own feelings and opinions. This will strengthen your argument and make it more convincing.

Your writing style shows that you’re trying to communicate your thoughts, but there are some inconsistencies in clarity and structure. Sentences are sometimes choppy or lack connection to the main idea, which can confuse the reader. Pay attention to how you link your thoughts together. You can improve your flow by using transition words and phrases that guide the reader through your argument.

Given that you seem to have a personal interest in this topic, I encourage you to dig deeper into the emotional consequences of technology. Consider researching more about the effects of technology on mental health and how different people might experience these changes differently. This will not only enhance your understanding but also give you more material to work with in your writing.

For your next draft, I suggest focusing on clarity and coherence. Try to develop each point more thoroughly and connect them logically. You might also think about including a personal anecdote or a real-world example to illustrate your point – this will make your argument more relatable and powerful. Finally, don’t forget to proofread and revise your work to polish it up before submitting. Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing how you improve in your next essay!"
F15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

Your essay presents an interesting perspective on the Facial Action Coding System and its potential impacts on interpersonal communication. You've clearly thought about the emotional implications of this technology, which is a crucial aspect of the discussion.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you raise important points about the emotional discomfort that this system might cause for some individuals. You also provide a relevant example with the Mona Lisa, which helps to illustrate your argument. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed. 

Firstly, your writing contains several grammatical errors and typos, such as ""sombody,"" ""wether,"" ""emberrass,"" and ""selfsteem."" These mistakes can distract the reader and make it harder to follow your arguments. Additionally, the structure of your essay could be more organized. It would benefit from clearer topic sentences and transitions between your ideas to help guide the reader through your points. Your conclusion needs to be stronger and more definitive as well; right now, it feels a bit rushed and doesn’t fully encapsulate your argument.

Let’s talk about the argument itself. You have a solid foundation, but you could develop it further. For instance, consider exploring both the positive and negative aspects of the Facial Action Coding System more deeply. It might also be helpful to include more examples or case studies to strengthen your argument and make it more relatable. 

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you are eager to engage with this topic, which is great! However, some of your expressions could be clearer and more refined. You have good ideas, but they sometimes get lost in translation due to the writing style. One way to improve would be to read your essay out loud; this can help you catch awkward phrasing or areas where the flow doesn’t make sense. 

As you continue to develop your writing, focus on clarity and structure. Spend some time reviewing grammar rules and practicing sentence construction. You might also consider outlining your essays before writing them to ensure that your ideas are organized logically. 

Overall, you have the potential to create a compelling essay, especially since you seem to have a genuine interest in this topic. With some revision and attention to detail, I believe your next draft could be even stronger. Keep working on it!"

Your essay on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" offers an interesting perspective on the artwork and its creator, Leonardo da Vinci. It's clear that you've engaged with the piece and are trying to express your thoughts about the emotions conveyed in the painting. However, the essay sometimes lacks clarity and organization, which can make it challenging for readers to follow your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is your attempt to interpret the mood of the Mona Lisa. You’ve captured a unique viewpoint about her expression and how it reflects a mix of emotions. This personal connection to the artwork is a compelling aspect of your writing. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed. The sentence structure can be confusing, and there are several grammatical errors that detract from your overall message. It's essential to proofread your work to ensure that your ideas are clearly communicated.

Your argument about the Mona Lisa's expression and the surrounding environment is intriguing, but it could be strengthened with more specific examples and a clearer structure. For instance, elaborating on why you perceive the background as thoughtful or lonely would enhance your argument. Additionally, using more descriptive language to convey your thoughts could make your writing more engaging. 

In terms of your writing ability, you show promise, particularly in your ability to connect with the subject matter. However, you need to work on your sentence structure and grammar to improve the overall flow of your writing. The style is conversational, which is great, but sometimes it feels a bit scattered. 

To develop your writing further, practice organizing your thoughts before you start writing. Consider creating an outline to help structure your essay logically. This will not only help clarify your points but also ensure that your arguments flow smoothly from one to the next. Additionally, working on your grammar and sentence construction will significantly enhance the clarity of your work.

Since you seem to have a genuine interest in the topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into the historical context of the painting and da Vinci's life. This could provide more depth to your analysis and make your essay more compelling. Keep exploring and expressing your thoughts, but remember to focus on clarity and structure as you do so."
F-M2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want his smile so they made a program and copywrited his smile and made it fake.

Overall, your essay has an interesting premise and shows a unique take on the Mona Lisa's expression and the technology surrounding it. It's clear that you have a passion for the subject, which is great! However, the essay could benefit from more clarity and organization to effectively communicate your ideas.

One of the strengths of your writing is the creativity behind your concept of a computer program that gives the Mona Lisa a smile. This approach is intriguing and could spark a lot of discussion. However, there are several areas that need improvement. For starters, the essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps between ideas without smooth transitions, making it a bit hard to follow. Additionally, there are numerous grammatical errors and misspellings that detract from the overall quality of your writing. For example, ""camra"" should be ""camera,"" and ""his"" should be ""her"" when referring to the Mona Lisa. 

When you present your argument about the emotions depicted in the painting and how the computer program works, it feels a bit disjointed. Your use of examples, like the percentages of emotions, is a good start, but it could be more effectively integrated into your argument. Consider explaining how these emotions relate to the artwork and why they are significant. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a strong voice, but it needs polishing. Your ideas are creative, but the execution can be improved. Your strengths lie in your imaginative approach; you clearly think outside the box. However, the weaknesses are quite evident in spelling, grammar, and overall coherence. 

To take your writing to the next level, I recommend focusing on structuring your essay. Start with a clear introduction that states your main idea, followed by body paragraphs that each focus on a single point. Make sure to provide clear examples and explanations, and end with a strong conclusion that ties everything together. Additionally, take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors. You might also find it helpful to read your essay out loud; this can help you catch mistakes and improve the flow of your writing.

Since you seem interested in the intersection of art and technology, consider researching more about Leonardo da Vinci and the significance of the Mona Lisa. This could add depth to your arguments and provide you with more material to work with. Keep writing and exploring your ideas!"
F-M3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

Your essay presents an interesting perspective on the emotions conveyed in the Mona Lisa, but it feels a bit scattered and could use more structure. It’s clear that you’re engaging with the topic and trying to express your own opinion, which is great. However, the points you make seem to jump around a bit, making it hard to follow your main argument. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your ability to challenge the conventional interpretations of the painting. You raise valid points about the limitations of reading emotions from facial expressions, especially in a historical context where we don’t have the full picture of the subject's life. However, the writing would benefit from clearer organization. For instance, you could start with a strong thesis statement that clearly outlines your disagreement with the author's interpretation. Then, develop your points systematically, ensuring each one flows logically to the next. 

When it comes to evaluating your argument, you bring up the facial feedback theory, which is a good reference, but I think it could be further elaborated. Try to provide a bit more context about this theory and how it relates to your argument. Also, while you mention the lack of eyebrows and how that affects emotional expression, consider diving deeper into why that detail matters in the context of your argument. Adding a bit more evidence or examples would strengthen your position and make it more persuasive. 

Your writing style shows potential, but it needs refinement. There are several spelling and grammatical errors—like ""wasnt"" instead of ""wasn't"" and ""expiriencing"" instead of ""experiencing""—which can distract from your message. Pay attention to these details, as they can impact the overall quality of your work. Moreover, some sentences are quite long and could be split into shorter, clearer ones. This would help maintain your reader's attention and make your points more impactful.

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic of art and emotions, I recommend diving deeper into art critique and emotional theory. Reading more about how different artists convey emotions through their work might provide you with additional insights and examples. I also suggest practicing writing with a focus on clarity and structure. Consider outlining your essays before you start writing to organize your thoughts more effectively. 

Overall, you have a promising start, but refining your structure and paying closer attention to your writing mechanics will greatly enhance your essays in the future. Keep up the interest and work on developing your ideas more clearly!"
F-M4,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that he was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if he's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with his at that time of the picture you would never know how he's feeling.

I appreciate the effort you've put into discussing the limitations of the Facial Coding System in understanding emotions. Your essay reflects a strong personal opinion and a clear stance on the topic, which is a great start. I can see that you’re trying to engage with the material, and that’s important in making your argument more compelling.

One of the main strengths of your essay is the personal touch you bring to the discussion. You express a clear belief that technology can't fully capture human emotions, and that’s a relatable viewpoint. However, your writing could benefit from more structure and clarity. It feels a bit disorganized at times, which can make it difficult for the reader to follow your argument. Also, there are several grammatical and spelling errors that distract from your message. For example, ""their"" should be ""they're"" in some contexts, and ""perent"" is a typo for ""percent."" Proofreading your work could help in catching these mistakes.

Your argument hinges on the idea that emotions cannot be accurately interpreted without personal context, which is valid. However, it would be stronger if you included more evidence or examples to back up your claims. For instance, instead of just stating that we can tell how someone is feeling by looking at them, you could provide examples of research or studies that highlight the differences between human perception and technological analysis of emotions. The mention of the Mona Lisa is interesting, but it could use more elaboration to show how that example directly ties into your overall argument.

When it comes to your writing style, you show a good voice, but it could be improved with clearer sentence structures. Some of your sentences are quite long and could be broken down into shorter ones for better readability. Additionally, varying your sentence length can help maintain the reader’s interest. Try to be more specific in your vocabulary as well; using precise words can strengthen your argument.

Since you seem interested in this topic, I suggest delving deeper into the research surrounding facial coding and emotional intelligence. Explore both sides of the argument to give your perspective more depth. Consider organizing your essay with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a single idea, and a conclusion that summarizes your main points. This will help your readers follow your thought process more easily.

Overall, I think you have the foundation of a strong essay, and with some focused revisions, it could become much more persuasive and engaging. Keep writing, and don’t hesitate to explore other viewpoints to enrich your arguments!"

Overall, you’ve done a commendable job of exploring the topic of studying Venus and laying out the author’s arguments. Your essay flows logically, and you maintain a clear focus on the central thesis. It’s evident that you understand the complexities involved in the exploration of Venus, and you’ve made a solid case for why these challenges don’t negate the value of such endeavors.

One of the essay’s strengths lies in your ability to summarize the author’s points effectively. You clearly articulate the dangers of Venus and the solutions proposed, which shows your comprehension of the material. However, there are areas for improvement. The essay could benefit from a bit more depth in your analysis. For example, while you mention the dangers and the solutions, expanding on the implications of these solutions or the potential impact of studying Venus would enrich your argument. Additionally, be mindful of minor typos and grammatical errors, as they can detract from the overall professionalism of your writing.

Your argument is generally well-supported, but there are moments where you could deepen your analysis. For instance, when discussing NASA’s plans, it would be helpful to elaborate on why these specific solutions are effective in a broader context. What makes a ""blimp-like vehicle"" preferable compared to other methods? Delving into these questions can bolster your argument and provide greater clarity to your readers.

In terms of writing ability, you demonstrate a solid grasp of sentence structure and vocabulary. There’s a natural flow to your writing that makes it easy to follow. However, your essay would benefit from a bit more variety in your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged. While your points are clear, try to incorporate more complex sentences or differing sentence lengths to create a rhythm in your writing. 

To enhance your essay, consider incorporating more specific details about the technologies NASA is testing and how they’ve been successful in addressing the challenges you mentioned. Adding a few more examples or quotes from the original text could also strengthen your arguments. Finally, always make sure to proofread for any spelling or grammatical issues; for example, “milles” should be corrected to “miles,” and “counditions” needs to be “conditions.” These small tweaks can significantly enhance the clarity and professionalism of your essay.

Overall, you’re on the right track, especially given your interest in the subject matter. With a bit more depth and attention to detail, your writing can become even more compelling. Keep up the great work!"

First off, I appreciate the effort you put into your essay about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile Again."" It’s clear you are engaged with the topic, and your enthusiasm shines through. However, the essay could benefit from some refining to present your ideas more clearly and effectively. 

One of the strengths of your writing is the unique perspective you bring to the subject. You touch on some interesting points, like how the computer model enhances the details of the painting. This is a creative angle and shows that you’re thinking critically about the art. That said, there are several areas where improvement is needed. The overall organization of your essay feels a bit scattered. You jump from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it hard for the reader to follow your argument. Additionally, there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. 

When it comes to your argument and the examples you provided, I think there’s potential for a deeper exploration of the themes you mention. For instance, you refer to the emotional expression of Mona Lisa but don’t delve into what that might mean or how it relates to your main point about the computer model. A more detailed discussion could strengthen your argument and provide a clearer insight into your perspective. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you demonstrate some good ideas, but the execution needs work. Your sentences are often choppy, and there are awkward phrases that could be smoothed out for better flow. For example, phrases like ""the computer model has better details in the picture"" could be rephrased for clarity. Pay attention to your sentence structure; varying it can make your writing more engaging. 

To enhance your essay, I suggest starting with a clear thesis statement that outlines your main argument. This will guide your writing and help the reader understand your perspective from the beginning. Make sure to provide specific examples that support your points, perhaps by discussing how the model compares to the original in terms of emotional expression or artistic technique. Lastly, take the time to proofread for grammar and spelling errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve the overall flow. 

Overall, I see a lot of potential in your ideas, and with a bit more organization and attention to detail, your writing can really shine. Keep exploring your thoughts on this fascinating topic, and don’t hesitate to dig deeper into the aspects that intrigue you!"

I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of technology that reads emotional expressions! It's clear that you're intrigued by how computers can interpret human emotions, especially when it comes to iconic artworks like the Mona Lisa. Your essay brings up some interesting points that would engage readers who share your interest in this field. However, there are several areas where you could improve both the clarity and the effectiveness of your argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is the choice of examples, particularly the Mona Lisa, which adds a unique angle to your discussion. You also attempt to explain complex technology in a relatable way, which is commendable. However, the writing contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from your message. For example, phrases like ""the technology fro read the emotionals expressions"" and ""can be change his smile"" are confusing and make it hard for readers to follow your ideas. Working on your sentence structure and grammar will significantly improve the overall quality of your writing.

Your argument has potential, but it feels a bit underdeveloped. While you mention how computers can differentiate between real and fake smiles, you don’t go into enough detail about how this technology works or why it matters. Providing more context and examples would strengthen your argument. Additionally, you could explore the implications of this technology on human interaction or art appreciation to make it even more engaging.

In terms of writing ability, it's clear that you're passionate about the subject, which is a great starting point! However, there are noticeable weaknesses in your grammar and coherence that need attention. To improve, I recommend focusing on sentence structure and clarity. Try breaking down your ideas into simpler sentences. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch awkward phrasing and grammatical mistakes. 

To enhance your essay, consider revising it with a focus on these aspects: clarify your main points, elaborate on the examples you provide, and ensure that each sentence is clear and grammatically correct. You might also want to explore additional sources or research studies about the technology you're discussing to back up your claims. This will not only boost your confidence as a writer but will also enrich your essay and make it more compelling to your readers. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your writing!"

I appreciate your effort in tackling an intriguing topic! You’ve chosen to write about a fascinating discovery related to Mars, and I can see you’re curious about different perspectives. Your enthusiasm shines through, and it’s great to see that you’re engaging with the ideas of your partner, Christina. 

However, the essay could benefit from more clarity and organization. The narrative jumps around a bit, which can make it difficult for the reader to follow your thoughts. For instance, the shift from your perspective to Christina's happens quickly, and it might be helpful to provide more context or explanations about why you both feel the way you do. 

One of your strengths is the way you incorporate quotes from the NASA announcement, which adds credibility to your argument. However, you could improve your writing by refining your grammar and punctuation. There are several instances of incorrect verb forms and punctuation issues that distract from your points. For example, “me and my partner Christina was” should be “my partner Christina and I were.” Paying attention to these details will make your writing clearer and more professional.

Your argument about the mask and its origins is interesting, but you could strengthen it by providing more evidence or elaborating on the viewpoints you and Christina hold. Consider explaining why you think it’s a natural formation in more detail and providing some scientific reasoning behind it. This would not only enhance your argument but also engage the reader more effectively.

In terms of your writing style, I see potential but also areas that need attention. While your conversational tone makes the essay relatable, the informal language at times detracts from the seriousness of the topic. Try to strike a balance between being approachable and maintaining an academic tone. Avoid phrases like “isnt it obivious” which can come off as unprofessional. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on sentence structure and grammar. Make sure to proofread your work for errors and consider breaking down complex ideas into simpler sentences. Practicing how to transition between thoughts smoothly will also help your flow. 

Overall, keep nurturing your interest in Mars and space exploration! With some refinements in your writing technique and a bit more focus on clarity and organization, you’ll be able to convey your thoughts much more effectively. Keep up the curiosity and good work!"

First off, I appreciate the passion you have for the topic of cars and their impact on the environment. You clearly care about this issue, and that enthusiasm shines through your writing. However, there are some areas where your essay could be improved to make your argument clearer and more persuasive. It's great to see you connecting your personal experiences with broader environmental concerns, but it feels a bit disjointed at times, which can make it hard for the reader to follow your main point.

One of the strengths of your essay is the personal anecdotes you included, like your interaction with your father about walking instead of driving. This adds a relatable touch and helps illustrate your viewpoint. However, you need to work on organizing your thoughts more clearly. For instance, the transitions between your personal experiences and the data from your sources could be smoother. Additionally, there are numerous grammatical and spelling errors that distract from your argument. Focusing on sentence structure and clarity will strengthen your writing significantly.

Your argument is relevant and timely, especially with the growing concerns about climate change. The statistics you referenced provide a solid foundation for your claims, but they could be better integrated into your essay. Try to explain how each piece of evidence supports your overall argument more explicitly. For example, when you mention greenhouse gas emissions, take a moment to explain why this matters and how it connects back to your desire for a car. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a conversational tone that can engage readers, which is a big plus! However, you should pay closer attention to grammar and punctuation. For example, words like ""bicycles"" and ""important"" were misspelled, and there were several awkward phrasing choices that made certain sentences hard to understand. Focusing on proofreading your work could help catch these mistakes. 

Since it seems like you have a genuine interest in the environmental impact of cars, I encourage you to dive deeper into this topic. Perhaps consider researching more about alternative transportation methods and their benefits. This would provide a broader context for your argument and could lead to a more compelling essay. Additionally, reading more essays or articles on environmental issues could help you develop a clearer writing style.

To enhance your essay, start by revising for clarity and organization. Make sure each paragraph has a clear main idea and flows logically to the next. Don’t hesitate to use more transitions to guide the reader. Also, take the time to proofread carefully to correct spelling and grammar errors. Finally, consider adding a conclusion that summarizes your points and reinforces your main argument about the importance of reducing car dependency. Keep up the hard work; you’re on the right track!"

I appreciate your effort in tackling such an important topic as the impact of vehicles on our environment. You've chosen a relevant and pressing issue, and your passion for the subject really shines through. However, there are areas where you can improve both clarity and structure to make your argument more compelling.

One of the strongest aspects of your essay is your enthusiasm for advocating environmental conservation. You clearly care about the planet and want to inspire others to take action, which is commendable. However, your essay could benefit from clearer organization. For instance, some of your ideas feel a bit scattered. Focusing on one main point at a time and expanding upon it would strengthen your overall argument. Additionally, make sure to proofread for spelling and grammatical errors, as these distract from the message you're trying to convey. For instance, ""vehical"" should be ""vehicle,"" and ""differnce"" should be ""difference."" These small mistakes can undermine your credibility.

Your argument about reducing carbon emissions through alternative transportation methods is a solid start, and it shows that you're thinking critically about solutions. However, it would be more persuasive if you could include some specific examples or statistics to support your points. For instance, mention how much carbon emissions could be reduced if more people used public transport or biked. You could also elaborate on the idea of cities being built closer together, providing examples of places that have successfully implemented this concept. This would not only strengthen your argument but also make it more relatable to your audience.

When it comes to your writing style, I see the potential for a strong voice, but clarity is key. There are moments where your sentences are long and convoluted, which can make it hard to follow your train of thought. Shorter, clearer sentences would help your points come across more effectively. Additionally, varying your sentence structure could keep the reader more engaged. Focus on using transition words to improve the flow between your ideas, which will help guide your reader through your argument.

Since you seem to have a personal interest in environmental issues, I encourage you to dive deeper into research about this topic. This can provide you with more insights and help you build a stronger case. Perhaps explore case studies of cities that have successfully reduced car usage or policies that have encouraged biking and public transport. 

Overall, your essay has a solid foundation, but with more organization, clarity, and supporting evidence, it could become a much more powerful piece. Keep up the passion, and don't shy away from refining your writing skills!"

First off, it’s clear that you have strong feelings about the topic you wrote about, which is great! Passion can really bring an essay to life. However, the way those thoughts are expressed needs some work. The overall impression of your essay is that it feels more like a stream of consciousness rather than a structured argument. While it's good to be candid, organizing your ideas will help make your points clearer and more impactful.

When it comes to strengths, your emotional engagement is definitely a plus. You’ve tapped into a real sense of frustration about analyzing moods from the past, which can resonate with readers. However, the areas for improvement are significant. The essay would benefit from clearer organization. Right now, it feels like a jumble of ideas without smooth transitions. Focusing on a main argument or thesis and developing it with supporting points would strengthen your writing immensely.

Your argument about leaving the past behind is interesting, but it lacks development. You mention that nobody cares about someone's mood in a historical context, but there are no examples or cases to back this up. Think about how you could expand on your point. Perhaps you could reference specific artworks or historical figures to illustrate your argument more effectively. Instead of just stating your feelings, try to analyze why understanding someone’s mood might matter in some contexts.

In terms of writing competency and style, you’ve got a conversational tone that makes your writing relatable, but the lack of clarity can confuse readers. The casual language and informal expressions can be engaging, but they need to be balanced with more precise language and structure. One major weakness is the grammar and spelling; for instance, words like ""soemones,"" ""hwat,"" and ""passed"" are misspelled. Taking the time to proofread your work can help avoid these small yet impactful errors.

Given that you seem to be interested in this topic, I would recommend focusing on developing your argument more thoroughly. Start with a clear thesis statement, and then build your essay around that. Consider outlining your main points before you start writing to help organize your thoughts. Also, try to use specific examples to support your claims. When discussing emotions in art or history, think about how certain moods can affect interpretations and why that might be important. 

As you revise this essay, aim for clarity and coherence, and don’t shy away from digging deeper into your ideas. This will not only strengthen your argument but also make your writing more engaging for your readers. Keep practicing, and I’m sure your writing will improve significantly!"

It's clear that you have some interesting ideas about how technology can help us connect with the emotions of others. However, the way those ideas are expressed could use some refinement to strengthen your overall message.

First off, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject. You clearly find the idea of technology tracking emotions fascinating, and that passion can translate into a compelling argument. However, there are a few structural and grammatical issues that make it difficult to follow your line of reasoning. Sentences sometimes run on or are incomplete, which can confuse the reader. Focusing on clarity will help your ideas shine through more effectively.

One of your strengths is your personal connection to the topic. You relate the emotional complexity of the Mona Lisa to the broader implications of technology in understanding feelings. This connection can resonate with readers, but it would be even stronger if you provided clearer examples and a more organized structure. For instance, the transitions between your points could be smoother, allowing readers to follow your thought process more easily.

When discussing the Mona Lisa and the emotions it conveys, there’s potential for a deeper analysis. You mention Ekman's six basic emotions, but it would help to elaborate on how these emotions relate specifically to the painting or how technology could interpret them. Drawing clearer connections between your examples and the main argument would bolster your essay significantly.

In terms of writing competency, you show a good grasp of the topic, but your style needs more polish. There are several spelling and grammatical errors that detract from your message, such as ""technologly,"" ""resson,"" and ""peecent."" These mistakes can distract readers from your ideas, so taking the time to proofread and revise can make a big difference. 

You’re clearly interested in the topic, as evidenced by your thoughts on how this technology might help people. However, working on sentence structure and coherence will help you communicate those thoughts more effectively. Consider practicing writing structured paragraphs with clear topic sentences and supporting details. You might also benefit from reading more essays or articles on similar topics to see how experienced writers organize their thoughts.

To enhance your essay, try breaking your ideas into clearer sections. Start with an introduction that outlines your main argument and then develop each point in its own paragraph. Make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar errors—tools like spell check can help, but reading your work out loud can also catch mistakes. Lastly, consider adding more specific examples or case studies to illustrate your points about the technology of emotion detection, which would provide a stronger foundation for your argument. 

Keep working on your writing, and I’m excited to see how your ideas evolve!"

First off, I appreciate the effort you put into discussing an important topic like car usage and its impact on the environment. It's clear that you're passionate about the subject, and that enthusiasm can really shine through in your writing. However, the essay needs some polishing to be more effective and coherent. 

You’ve got some good ideas here, but there are areas that need improvement. For one, the organization could be better. Your points jump around a bit, which makes it hard to follow your argument. Additionally, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that detract from the overall quality of the writing. For instance, “monther” should be “mother,” and “thoes” should be “those.” These little mistakes can distract readers from your main points. 

Your argument about limiting car use is valid, especially with the statistic about greenhouse gases. However, it would be stronger if you provided more concrete examples. The mention of a town that banned cars is interesting, but you could elaborate on that. What changes did the residents notice? How did it affect their daily lives? These details can help paint a clearer picture for your audience and make your argument more compelling. 

When it comes to your writing style, you show promise, but the execution needs work. The tone is engaging, which is great; however, clarity is key. Some sentences are a bit awkward and could be simplified for better flow. For example, instead of saying, “they had Feet,” consider rephrasing that to something like, “they relied on walking.” It’s a small change, but it makes a big difference in readability. 

Considering your interest in this topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into the research. Look for more statistics or case studies that can strengthen your argument. Additionally, practicing your grammar and sentence structure will help you communicate your ideas more clearly. Try reading your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrasing or errors. This can also help you find a rhythm in your writing. 

Overall, you’ve got a solid foundation, and with some revisions and attention to detail, you can elevate this essay to the next level. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas further!"

I appreciate your effort in exploring such a complex topic as technology and emotions. It’s clear that you’re trying to express a personal viewpoint, which is a great starting point for your writing. However, the essay feels a bit disjointed and lacks clarity in some areas, making it challenging for the reader to fully grasp your arguments.

One of the strengths of your essay is your attempt to connect personal feelings with technology and how it impacts emotions. This is an important and thought-provoking topic, and your perspective adds a layer of depth. However, there are several areas where you can improve. For instance, your writing would benefit from clearer organization. Each paragraph should ideally focus on a single idea, with a bit more detail and explanation to support your claims. Additionally, pay attention to grammar and spelling, as this can greatly affect how your ideas are communicated. 

Your argument presents an interesting point about not wanting technology to invade personal feelings, but it could use more concrete examples or evidence. For instance, when you mention the article, it would be helpful to include specific details or quotes that reinforce your arguments. The image of the man with a fake smile is a strong visual, but elaborating on that could make your point even more impactful. Consider discussing how this relates to the broader implications of emotional technology and the potential consequences it might have on human relationships.

In terms of writing competency and style, it seems like you have an engaging voice, but you need to work on clarity and coherence. Your sentences sometimes run together, making it hard for readers to follow your thoughts. Focus on breaking your ideas into shorter sentences and using transitions that guide your reader through your essay. 

One of your strengths is your willingness to express your opinions, which is fantastic. However, be mindful of phrasing and grammar—typos and incorrect word choices can distract from your message. A targeted recommendation would be to read your essay aloud after writing it; this often helps to catch awkward phrasing and errors. Furthermore, taking the time to revise your work can make a significant difference. Consider using tools like spell check or grammar check, and don’t hesitate to ask peers or teachers for feedback before submitting.

Overall, I see a lot of potential in your writing, especially given your interest in the topic. Keep pushing yourself to clarify your thoughts and present them in a structured way. With a little more attention to detail and organization, your writing can become much more effective. Keep working at it!"
F-M15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe he never talk about how he felt when the picture was took and people just say he was happy and he wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

Overall, your essay presents an interesting perspective on the Facial Action Coding System and its implications. You clearly have a passion for the topic, which is great to see. However, the clarity of your argument and the structure of your writing need some work to make your ideas shine through more effectively.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you touch on the emotional complexities involved with using the Facial Action Coding System. It’s important to acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable expressing their feelings, and you've made a solid point about the potential discomfort this technology might cause. However, there are areas where your writing could improve. For instance, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from your message. Additionally, your conclusion feels a bit rushed and could benefit from a clearer summary of your main points.

Your argument is intriguing, particularly your take on how this technology could misrepresent people's feelings. However, I think you could strengthen your argument by providing more examples or evidence to back up your claims. For instance, discussing specific scenarios where this technology might be helpful or harmful could give your reader a better understanding of your viewpoint. You mention the Mona Lisa, which is a creative example, but it could be even more powerful if you connected it back to real-life situations or studies about emotional expression.

In terms of writing competency, I can see you have a good grasp of the topic, but the execution needs refining. Some of the sentences are quite long and can be hard to follow, which makes it difficult for your reader to grasp your points easily. You also have spelling and grammatical issues, such as ""sombody,"" ""emberrass,"" and ""selfsteem,"" which can distract from your ideas. 

To enhance your writing, I recommend focusing on sentence structure and clarity. Try breaking longer sentences into shorter, more digestible ones. Additionally, give your essay a thorough proofreading to catch those spelling errors. Consider drafting an outline before you write to help organize your thoughts better. It might also be helpful to incorporate more solid examples and data to support your ideas, particularly since you seem interested in the psychological aspects of the topic. 

Overall, you show promise in your writing and thinking, and with some focused effort on these areas, you can improve significantly. Keep exploring your ideas and refining your skills; it’s exciting to see where you can take this!"
