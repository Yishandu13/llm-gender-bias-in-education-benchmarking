","I would score this essay a 2 out of 5. 

Overall, it's clear that you have a strong interest in the topic of Luke and the Seagoing Cowboys, and that enthusiasm is important! However, the essay feels a bit disorganized and lacks clarity. It’s like you have some great ideas, but they need more structure to really shine through.

One of the main strengths of your writing is your personal connection to the topic. You express a genuine interest in the character of Luke and his aspirations. It’s great to see that you care about his journey and want to convey that to your readers. However, there are several areas that could use improvement. For instance, your sentences often feel repetitive, and there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors, such as “actullay” and “dissions.” These can distract from your main ideas and make it harder for your reader to follow your thoughts. 

When it comes to the argument and examples, the essay could benefit from more concrete details. You mention Luke’s desire to become a Seagoing Cowboy and how it might make him happy, which is a solid point. However, you could really strengthen your argument by providing specific examples of how this program could impact Luke’s life positively. Perhaps you could describe what he might learn or how it aligns with his goals. This would help to make your case much stronger.

In terms of writing ability, you clearly have some strong ideas, but the execution is a bit rough around the edges. Your style shows passion, which is fantastic, but it can sometimes come off as confusing. The repeated phrases and lack of varied sentence structure can make your writing feel monotonous. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on organizing your ideas more clearly. Try outlining your essay before you start writing, which can help you see how to structure your arguments logically. Pay attention to grammar and spelling, as these are crucial for clear communication. You might consider reading your essay out loud to catch any awkward phrases or mistakes that you might miss when reading silently. Also, since you seem interested in this topic, maybe do some research on the Seagoing Cowboys or related programs to add depth to your arguments.

Keep working at it! You’ve got the enthusiasm, and with a bit more focus on clarity and structure, your writing can truly reflect that passion."
M2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Let’s dive into my thoughts. 

First off, I appreciate the effort you put into tackling the topic of Luke as a sea-going cowboy. It’s clear you have a strong opinion on the matter, and you’re passionate about sharing your perspective. I like that you’re trying to engage with the story and draw conclusions from it. However, the overall structure and clarity of your argument need a bit more work. The essay feels somewhat disjointed, making it hard for readers to follow your main points.

One of the strengths of your essay is your use of specific examples from Luke’s experiences, like the hourly roll call and the incident with the metal pole. These moments add interest and show that you have a grasp of the story's events. On the other hand, there’s a significant need for improvement in your writing mechanics. For instance, spelling errors like ""acording"" and ""paragrah4"" distract from your message. Additionally, your sentences often run on and could benefit from clearer organization. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea you want to discuss. 

When it comes to your argument about why Luke shouldn’t be a sea-going cowboy, you’ve made some good points. The potential for injury and illness is definitely a valid concern. However, your essay would be stronger if you offered more concrete examples and explained them in detail. For instance, you mention that he could get hurt or sick, but a bit more elaboration on those points would really strengthen your case. It's also important to ensure that your paragraphs flow well from one to another, so readers can easily see how each point connects to your overall argument.

In terms of writing style, you show enthusiasm, which is fantastic! However, working on sentence structure and grammar would greatly enhance your writing. You have some great ideas and a clear interest in the topic, but polishing your writing mechanics will make your argument more compelling. 

To improve your essay, I recommend focusing on organizing your thoughts more clearly. Start with a strong introduction that clearly states your thesis. Each paragraph should have a topic sentence that supports that thesis, followed by examples that are clearly explained. Don't forget to proofread for spelling and grammatical errors; reading your essay out loud can help catch mistakes that might slip past you otherwise. Lastly, try to connect your ideas more fluidly so that the reader can easily follow your argument. 

Keep at it! With a little more attention to detail and organization, I can see your writing really shining."

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Let’s talk about your overall impression. Your enthusiasm for the topic clearly shows, and it’s great that you’re passionate about Luke and the Seagoing Cowboys program. You have some interesting ideas about how he helps animals and travels, but the essay feels a bit jumbled and could use more organization. It’s important to have a clear structure so your readers can easily follow your thoughts.

In terms of strengths, your passion for the Seagoing Cowboys program really shines through. You also offer some personal insight into what you would feel if you were in Luke's position, which adds a nice touch. However, there are definitely areas for improvement. Your essay would benefit from clearer sentences and better punctuation. There are several grammatical errors, such as contractions that are misused, and run-on sentences that make it hard to understand the main points.

When evaluating your argument, it feels a bit scattered. You have some good ideas, but they need to be more focused. For example, you mention Luke's injuries and how they affect him, but it feels like you jump around a lot without fully exploring each point. You could strengthen your argument by providing more specific examples of what he does in the program and how it impacts both him and the animals he cares for.

As for your writing ability, you show potential, but there are some significant weaknesses to address. Your style could be more polished, and right now, it’s a bit informal and lacks clarity. A big part of writing is making sure that your reader can understand what you’re trying to say without getting lost in long sentences. 

To develop further, I recommend focusing on sentence structure. Try breaking up long sentences into shorter ones to help with clarity. Also, take some time to proofread your work for grammatical errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve flow. Additionally, consider creating an outline before you start writing to help organize your thoughts better. This way, you can make sure your essay has a clear beginning, middle, and end.

I can see that you have a genuine interest in the Seagoing Cowboys program, which is fantastic! Use that enthusiasm to fuel your writing. If you dig a little deeper into the specifics of what Luke experiences, both the challenges and the rewards, your essay will become much more engaging. Good luck, and I look forward to seeing how you improve!"

","I’d give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Overall, I appreciate the enthusiasm you have for the topic, and it’s clear that you’re interested in sharing your thoughts about the job. There are some intriguing ideas in your writing, but the execution could use a lot of improvement. The structure feels a bit scattered, which makes it hard to follow your main argument. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the subject. You express how much the job means to you and the joy it can bring. However, the areas that need improvement are quite significant. For starters, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that disrupt the flow of your writing. Words like ""sould"" (should), ""acrossed"" (across), and ""hores"" (horses) are mistakes that can easily be fixed with careful proofreading. Additionally, your ideas jump around a lot without clear transitions, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand your main point.

Your argument is based on the idea that people should pursue a job they enjoy, and while this is a valid point, it would be stronger if you provided more specific examples or personal experiences to support your claims. You mention that the character you’re discussing loves their job and doesn't care about the changes it brings, but it would help to elaborate on why this passion is important. Maybe share a specific moment that illustrates their love for the job or describe what makes it so appealing.

When it comes to your writing ability, you clearly have a voice that shines through, which is a great asset. However, your writing style needs more organization and clarity. It’s important to construct your essay with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion to help guide the reader. 

To develop your writing skills further, I recommend practicing sentence structure and grammar. Consider breaking down your ideas into smaller, more manageable parts, and make use of paragraphs to separate different thoughts. You might also benefit from reading other essays or articles on similar topics to see how they structure their arguments and use evidence. 

Lastly, take your time to revise your work before submitting it. Reading aloud can help you catch mistakes and see where your ideas could flow better. Keep writing and exploring your thoughts on this job, and I’m sure you’ll improve with practice!"
M5,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

","Your essay presents some interesting thoughts about the life of a seagoing cowboy and its appeal for young boys. I would give your essay a score of 3 out of 5. 

You’ve made a solid effort in discussing the central ideas of the passage and sharing your perspective. It’s clear that you find the topic fascinating, which is great! However, the structure of your essay could be improved to make your points clearer and more engaging for the reader. 

One of the strengths of your writing is that you convey enthusiasm for the subject. You show genuine interest in the experiences of being a seagoing cowboy, and that passion shines through. However, there are several areas where you could enhance your writing. For instance, try to organize your thoughts better. Some of your sentences feel a bit jumbled, making it hard to follow your main ideas. Additionally, there are a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. For example, “fro” should be “for,” and “havig” should be “having.” Taking a bit more time to proofread can really help polish your work. 

As for your argument and use of examples, you do well by illustrating the adventures and opportunities presented in the passage. However, the examples you provide could be more detailed. For instance, when you mention Luke’s record for the most trips, elaborating on why that’s significant or what it means for him could strengthen your argument. Also, mentioning more about his experiences would create a more vivid picture for your readers. 

When it comes to your writing competency and style, you have a good foundation, but there's room for growth. You express your thoughts in an approachable way, which makes it easy to read. To improve, focus on sentence structure and clarity. Some sentences are a bit long and can be broken into shorter ones for better flow. Also, ensure that you’re using correct punctuation and checking for typos before submitting your work. 

If you’re genuinely interested in the life of a seagoing cowboy, consider diving deeper into the experiences of those who have done it. Researching more about their adventures could provide you with more material to work with. You might also want to read examples of essays that argue a point or tell a story effectively, which can help you see how to organize your own writing better. 

Overall, with a bit more focus on organization, detail, and proofreading, your writing can really shine. Keep exploring this topic, as it clearly excites you, and don’t hesitate to share your voice and ideas more fully!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Overall, you’ve made a commendable effort to tell the story of Luke Bomberger and his experiences as a seagoing cowboy. It’s clear that you have a passion for this topic, and you’ve included some interesting details about his life and adventures. However, the essay lacks clarity and organization, which makes it difficult for readers to follow your main ideas.

One of the strengths of your writing is that you’ve included various aspects of Luke's life, from his initial reasons for joining to the fun and challenges he faced at sea. These details add color to the narrative. However, there are several areas where you could improve. The essay would benefit from clearer sentence structure and more careful proofreading to catch spelling and grammatical errors. For example, “grocrey” should be “grocery,” and “tournements” should be “tournaments.” Additionally, some sentences are a bit jumbled, making it hard to understand the flow of ideas. 

Your argument about why Luke wanted to become a seagoing cowboy is intriguing, but it could be developed further. You mention that he was drafted and that it was an opportunity of a lifetime, but it would help to elaborate on what that opportunity meant to him personally. You also touch on the fun activities aboard the ship and the dangers he faced, but these sections could be more connected to your main argument about his heroism and the impact he had on others. A more cohesive narrative would strengthen your essay overall.

In terms of writing competency and style, I see that you're capable of sharing engaging stories, but you need to work on clarity and coherence. Some of your sentences feel choppy or incomplete, which disrupts the flow of your essay. For instance, “he was only 18 whe he was drafted” could be rephrased for better clarity. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend reading your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing and errors. It’s also helpful to create an outline before you start writing to organize your thoughts. Consider adding transitions between your ideas to make the essay flow more smoothly. Lastly, I encourage you to dive deeper into Luke’s motivations and the significance of his experiences, as this will enrich your narrative and give readers a more profound understanding of his journey.

Keep going with your writing! With some revisions and careful editing, you can turn this essay into a compelling piece that truly reflects Luke's story."
M7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

","I would give this essay a score of 2.5 out of 5. There’s a good foundation here, but it needs some work to really shine. 

Overall, the impression I get from your essay is that you have a genuine interest in the Seagoing Cowboys program, and that enthusiasm comes through. You’ve clearly summarized some of the experiences shared by Luke, which is a nice touch. However, the writing feels a bit rushed and disorganized. It would benefit from clearer structure and more detail. 

One of your strengths is that you highlight specific experiences from Luke’s journey, which adds a personal touch to your argument. It’s great that you mention both the fun activities and the responsibilities on board the ship. However, there are some areas where you can improve. For instance, there are several spelling errors, such as ""exsperences"" and ""abourd,"" which distract from your message. Additionally, some sentences feel incomplete or awkward, making it hard for the reader to follow your train of thought. 

When it comes to your argument, I see a solid foundation, but it needs to be more persuasive. You mention that Luke’s life was changed, but you could delve deeper into what that change looked like and why it matters. Providing more personal reflections or examples of how this program impacts participants would really strengthen your case. 

In terms of writing style and competency, I can see that you have potential, but there are definitely areas for growth. Your ideas are there, but they need to be communicated more clearly. One of your strengths is your ability to convey enthusiasm about the subject, which is a big plus. On the other hand, be mindful of your word choice and sentence structure. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend taking some time to proofread your work for spelling and grammar mistakes. Maybe try reading your essay out loud; that can help you catch awkward phrasing. Additionally, work on expanding your ideas. Think about how you can connect more deeply with the reader by sharing personal insights or additional examples. This could make your argument much more compelling. 

Finally, given your interest in the Seagoing Cowboys program, consider researching more about its impact on former participants. This could give you additional insights and examples to incorporate into your essay, making it even stronger. Keep practicing, and I look forward to seeing your next draft!"
M8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.","

","I would rate your essay a 2 out of 5. While you’ve made some interesting points about how the story would change if it were told in the first person, there are quite a few areas that need attention to strengthen your writing. 

Let’s take a moment to talk about your overall impression. You’ve got a clear understanding of the story’s themes and how a first-person perspective might shift the reader's experience. It’s great that you’re thinking critically about the narrative! However, your ideas are often repeated and some sentences feel a bit jumbled. This can make it hard for the reader to follow your thoughts clearly. 

Now, let’s dive into strengths and areas for improvement. You clearly have an enthusiasm for the topic, and you bring up some valid points regarding Luke’s thoughts and feelings. This shows your engagement with the material. However, you need to work on organizing your ideas more logically. Right now, some of your sentences run on, which can confuse the reader. Focusing on one idea at a time and making sure each sentence flows into the next would greatly improve clarity. 

When it comes to your argument and the use of examples, you’ve mentioned some important moments that would have been highlighted in a first-person narrative, which is a solid approach. However, you could strengthen your argument by providing more specific examples from the text. Instead of saying, “we would have known what he thought about Italy,” you could include a direct quote or a specific scene that illustrates how he felt. That would make your points more convincing.

As for your writing ability, I see a lot of potential, but there are definitely some areas for growth. Your ideas are there, and you clearly have a lot to say, but your style doesn’t always convey that effectively. The main weaknesses are the run-on sentences and some spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your points. For example, “saide” should be “said,” and “getting” is misspelled as “geting.” 

To develop your writing skills further, I recommend practicing breaking down your ideas into smaller, more manageable parts. Try writing outlines before you start, which can help you structure your thoughts. Additionally, read through your work after writing to catch any errors and make sure it flows well. Finally, consider seeking out feedback on individual sentences or paragraphs to refine your style.

Overall, it’s clear that you have a passion for this topic, which is fantastic! With some focused effort on organization, clarity, and grammar, you’ll be able to express your ideas even more effectively. Keep writing and revising, and you’ll see improvement in no time!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. It shows effort and a personal connection to the topic, but there are several areas that need significant improvement to make it more coherent and engaging.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of World War II and your attempt to tell Luke Bombeger’s story. It’s clear that you are interested in this historical period, and that’s a great foundation for your writing. However, the essay suffers from a lack of organization and clarity. The narrative jumps around quite a bit, making it difficult to follow Luke's journey and his experiences. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your ability to convey an emotional connection to the character. The personal elements, like sending postcards to family and the struggles he faced, add depth. But there are many areas for improvement. For example, the structure of your sentences often makes it hard to understand the main ideas. There are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message, and some parts of the story could use more detail to paint a clearer picture for the reader. 

As for the argument and use of examples, while you included some interesting anecdotes about Luke’s life, they need more context and clarity. For instance, when you mention his experiences in the war, it would be helpful to elaborate on how these experiences shaped him as a person. This would strengthen your narrative and provide a deeper insight into his character. 

In evaluating your writing ability, I see potential, especially in your ability to tell a story. However, the execution needs refinement. Your strengths lie in your creativity and the emotional aspects you are trying to convey. Yet, the weaknesses are in grammar, sentence structure, and clarity. 

To improve, I recommend focusing on organizing your thoughts more clearly before writing. Perhaps create an outline of the main points you want to cover about Luke’s life and experiences. Pay attention to sentence structure; try breaking up longer sentences into shorter ones to enhance clarity. Additionally, make sure to proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. 

Overall, I can see your passion for the subject shines through, and with some practice and attention to detail, you can create a more compelling and coherent story. Keep working at it!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

First off, your overall impression of the essay is that it has a good foundation and an interesting premise. You tell a story about Luke’s experiences with surfing and his journey from uncertainty to joy, which is great. It’s clear that you have a passion for the topic, and that enthusiasm shines through. However, the essay feels a bit scattered and could benefit from more organization and clarity. 

When it comes to strengths, the idea that Luke finds joy in trying something new is a positive aspect of your essay. It shows personal growth and exploration, which is a great message. On the flip side, there are several areas where you could improve. The essay would be much stronger with better structure—consider breaking it into clear paragraphs. This will help guide your reader through Luke’s experiences more smoothly. Additionally, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message, so paying attention to that will definitely help. 

As for the argument and examples you used, you’ve set up a nice contrast between Luke’s excitement and the opinions of others who didn’t enjoy the trip. However, the argument could be more developed. You mention that some people didn’t enjoy the experience, but you don’t expand on that. Why didn’t they like it? Adding more detail would make your argument stronger and give your reader more to think about. 

Looking at your writing ability, I can see that you have a good grasp of storytelling elements, but there’s room for improvement in your writing style. Your enthusiasm is clear, which is a strength, but the execution falls short due to a lack of clarity and coherence. You could work on sentence structure and punctuation to make your writing more polished. 

To develop further, I recommend reading more essays or stories to see how they are structured. Pay attention to how they introduce ideas, support them with examples, and conclude effectively. Also, try proofreading your work for spelling and grammar before submitting it. For instance, “definitely” and “experience” are misspelled in your essay. Taking a little extra time on these details will make a big difference. 

Overall, I can see you’re interested in this topic, and that’s fantastic! Keep working on organizing your thoughts and refining your writing skills, and you’ll see improvement in no time."
M11,"He's convincing people to be a seagoing by saying you can go to nice places. He said that one time he went to a place with streets of water.

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Overall, your writing shows enthusiasm for the topic of being a seagoing, and it's clear that you have a lot to say about the experiences involved. However, the essay could benefit from more organization and clarity. I can see you're passionate about the subject, but the ideas sometimes feel jumbled together, making it hard to follow your main argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is the personal touch you add by sharing the experiences of Luke and his adventures. This not only makes the essay engaging but also helps bring the topic to life. However, there are quite a few areas that need improvement. For one, the essay contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which can distract the reader. Words like ""borad,"" ""toke,"" and ""yous"" need to be corrected. Also, some sentences are a bit run-on or unclear; breaking them into shorter, more concise statements would help. 

As for your argument and examples, while you have provided several anecdotes about Luke’s experiences, they could be better tied to your main point about why someone should consider being a seagoing. It seems like you have a lot of good material, but it needs to be structured in a way that clearly supports your argument. 

In terms of writing competency and style, I can see that you have a unique voice, which is great! However, clarity is essential, and your writing currently feels a bit choppy. Work on your sentence structure and try to vary your sentence lengths to improve the flow. 

Your enthusiasm for the topic is evident, which is a huge strength! To develop further, I recommend focusing on your sentence structure and grammar. Reading your essay aloud can help you catch awkward phrasing and errors. Additionally, consider creating an outline before you start writing so that your ideas are organized logically. This will help ensure that each part of your essay clearly supports your main argument. 

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build upon, and with a bit of revision and focus on clarity, your writing can shine even brighter! Keep up the effort, and I’m looking forward to seeing how your writing develops."
M12,"The author supported his ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". He explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe he did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. He didnt just focus on one thing he focused on it all and he put his paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how he restated the question that he had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs he learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that he explained both bad and good thing about venus. He sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about and he knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

","I’d give this essay a score of 3 out of 5. You’ve got a solid foundation, but there’s definitely room for improvement in clarity and detail.

Let’s start with the overall impression. You’ve put in a good effort to summarize the author’s points about Venus, and I appreciate that you recognized the balance of pros and cons. However, some of your ideas feel a bit underdeveloped, which makes it hard for the reader to fully grasp your thoughts. Try to elaborate more on your points so that your arguments come through clearly.

One of the strengths of your essay is the way you mention that the author tackled both the positive and negative aspects of Venus. Acknowledging different perspectives adds depth to your writing. However, there are areas that could use some polishing. For one, your sentences sometimes run together and could benefit from clearer structure. For example, terms like “maner” and “puting” need to be corrected for clarity. Additionally, using more specific examples from the essay would help strengthen your argument.

When it comes to evaluating your argument and use of examples, it’s clear that you’re trying to convey that the author is knowledgeable. Still, you could enhance your essay by including specific examples or quotes to back up your claims. This would not only demonstrate your understanding of the material but also help the reader connect with your analysis.

In terms of writing ability, you show potential, but there are some noticeable weaknesses in grammar and organization. Your ideas are interesting, but they come across as a bit jumbled at times, making it hard for the reader to follow your train of thought. To improve, focus on crafting clear topic sentences for each paragraph. This will guide your reader through your essay more effectively.

Since you seem interested in Venus and space exploration, I suggest diving deeper into research about the planet. This way, you can use more specific examples and facts in your writing. Additionally, practicing your proofreading skills will help catch those spelling errors and improve sentence structure. 

Overall, you’ve done a good job tackling a complex topic, but take the time to refine your writing, provide more specific details, and give your arguments a stronger backbone. Keep at it!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2.5 out of 5. 

Overall, your essay touches on some important ideas about the Seagoing Cowboys program and the impact it has on individuals like Luke Bomberger. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic, and it’s clear that you see value in helping others through this program. However, the essay feels a bit scattered and could benefit from more focus and structure. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion for the Seagoing Cowboys and what they represent. You highlight the fun and rewarding aspects of helping others, which is a good starting point. However, there are several areas where you can improve. For instance, your sentences sometimes lack clarity, and there are spelling and grammatical errors that can distract the reader. Additionally, it would be helpful to organize your thoughts more clearly, perhaps by outlining the main points you want to make before you start writing.

When it comes to your argument, you have made a decent attempt at explaining why being a Seagoing Cowboy is beneficial. However, including specific examples or anecdotes about Luke’s experiences would strengthen your argument significantly. Instead of just stating that helping people is fun, you could describe a particular moment that illustrates this enjoyment or the impact it had on someone’s life. This would give your writing more depth and make it more engaging.

In terms of writing competency and style, it's clear that you're trying to express your thoughts, which is great. However, your writing could be more polished. There are several spelling errors, such as “alot,” “convensing,” and “greatfull,” which should be corrected. Additionally, varying your sentence structure would make your writing more interesting. Right now, many of your sentences are quite similar in length and style, which can make the essay feel monotonous.

As someone who is interested in the topic, you have a good foundation to build on. To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on a few key areas: first, make sure to proofread your work to catch spelling and grammatical mistakes. Second, try organizing your ideas into paragraphs that each focus on one main point. Lastly, think about including specific examples that illustrate your points more vividly.

In conclusion, I encourage you to keep exploring the topic of helping others through the Seagoing Cowboys. With some attention to detail and a bit more structure in your writing, I believe you can create an even stronger essay. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing how you improve in your future writing!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Let’s dive into what you’ve written. Overall, it’s clear that you have a strong opinion about Luke’s trip and that you want to share your thoughts with the reader. You’ve set up a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is a great start!

One of the strengths of your essay is your enthusiasm for the topic. It’s great to see that you’re excited about the idea of exploration and learning new things. You also touch on some interesting points about the potential risks of the trip, which adds depth to your argument. However, there are some areas where you could improve. For instance, there are quite a few spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. Words like ""existed,"" ""also,"" and ""environment"" need to be checked for spelling. Additionally, your sentences could be more fluid; right now, they feel a bit choppy in places. 

When it comes to your argument, you’ve made a good attempt at presenting both sides of the decision Luke has to make. However, you could strengthen your argument by providing more specific examples and details. For instance, when you mention that Luke could ""explore,"" what does that mean? Maybe give a few examples of what he might discover or learn. Also, while you mention that the trip could be risky, you could explore those risks a bit more. Why might those things happen? What could Luke do to mitigate those risks? 

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you have a solid foundation, but there are definitely areas to develop. Your ideas are there, but they sometimes need a bit more clarity and support. Work on your sentence structure and aim for a more varied style. Try reading your sentences out loud to see how they flow; this can help you catch awkward phrasing.

To make your essay even better, consider outlining your main points more clearly before you start writing. This will help you stay organized and ensure that each paragraph has a clear focus. Don’t forget to proofread your work for spelling and grammar before you submit it, too. And when you're making your arguments, think about adding specific examples or anecdotes that relate to your points. 

Overall, you’re on the right track! Keep writing, and remember that every draft is a chance to improve. "

","I would score your essay a 2 out of 5. There's a lot of potential in your writing, but it needs more structure and clarity to really shine.

Overall, I appreciate the enthusiasm you have for the topic, and it's clear that you're interested in sharing a story about Luke and his experiences after World War II. The idea of helping devastated countries by transporting livestock and resources is a meaningful one, and you seem passionate about it. However, the essay feels a bit jumbled, making it hard for readers to follow the main points and understand the timeline of events.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you tackle a significant historical context, which shows you’ve chosen a topic of importance. The personal narrative about Luke's experiences on the cattle boat adds a nice touch, making the story relatable. However, the areas that need improvement include clarity in your writing and better organization of your ideas. It would help to break your essay into clearer sections with separate paragraphs for different thoughts. Also, pay close attention to spelling and grammar, as there are numerous errors that distract from your message.

When evaluating your argument and use of examples, it seems like you had a great idea in mind, but it got a bit lost in execution. You mention important points like the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, but the connection between your ideas needs to be clearer. For instance, elaborating on how Luke’s actions fit into the larger mission of the UNRRA would strengthen your argument. Consider tying back your anecdotes to the larger themes you're discussing so that everything feels interconnected.

Regarding your writing ability, I can see that you're capable of sharing meaningful content, but you'll benefit from focusing on the clarity and flow of your writing. One strength is your ability to introduce interesting facts about the historical context; however, your weaknesses lie in grammar, punctuation, and organization. You should work on structuring your sentences better and ensuring that each idea flows logically into the next. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend starting with an outline before you write. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your essay has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Take the time to proofread your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Tools like spell check or grammar check can help, but also reading your essay out loud can catch mistakes that you might miss when reading silently. Lastly, consider adding more detail and context to your anecdotes to make them more impactful and connected to your main theme. 

Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your writing skills further!"

","I would give this essay a score of 1 out of 5. 

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic, and it's clear that you have a strong interest in the program and its potential benefits for Luke. However, the essay lacks clarity and organization, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow your thoughts. It feels more like a stream of consciousness rather than a structured argument. 

One of the strengths of your writing is the passion you express for the subject matter. It’s evident that you care about Luke’s choices and aspirations. However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which hinder its readability. Additionally, you tend to repeat phrases and ideas, leading to a lack of depth in your argument. To enhance your writing, it would be beneficial to focus on developing clear, concise sentences and organizing your ideas logically before writing. 

When evaluating your argument, I noticed that while you touch on Luke's interests and aspirations, you don't provide strong evidence or examples to support your claims. For instance, you mention that Luke wants to be a Seagoing Cowgirl, but you don’t explain why this is important to her or how the program could specifically help her achieve her goals. Incorporating more detailed examples or scenarios would strengthen your argument significantly.

In terms of writing competency and style, there is potential here, but it needs refining. The enthusiasm you have for the topic is great, but clarity is key in writing. Your strengths lie in your passion and your willingness to express your thoughts, but the weaknesses include grammar, spelling, and structure. Focusing on these areas can make a significant difference. 

To improve your essay, I recommend starting with an outline before you write. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that each paragraph has a clear main idea. Try to eliminate repetitive phrases and instead delve deeper into your arguments. Proofreading your work for spelling and grammatical errors is crucial, so consider reading it out loud or using tools that help catch mistakes. Lastly, think about adding specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate Luke's interests and how the program could benefit her. This will make your essay more engaging and persuasive. 

With practice and attention to these details, I believe you can develop a much stronger essay that clearly conveys your ideas. Keep writing, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help when you need it!"
M-F2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowgirl.This is why in paragraph 2 she said when she went over seas world war ll was begining, if she was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat she was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when she was on the boat she had an hourly role call acording to the story she fell and cracked her ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop her she would have went over board and eaten by a shark but she was fine she had to take a break for a couple of days. Why she should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowgirl is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if she keeps up what she is doing she will get really hurt do her job any more.

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. While it touches on an interesting topic, there are several areas where clarity and structure can be improved.

First off, the overall impression I get from your essay is that you have a solid idea about why Luke shouldn't be a sea-going cowgirl, but the way you present your thoughts feels a bit jumbled. The main points you’re trying to make are there, but they are often hard to follow because of some grammatical issues and unclear phrasing. It’s also important to have a clear structure in your paragraphs so that your arguments stand out more effectively.

One strength of your essay is that you bring up some important points about the dangers of being a sea-going cowgirl, such as getting hurt or seasick. However, the examples you provide could use more detail and clarity. For instance, when you mention Luke cracking her ribs, it would be helpful to explain how this connects to your overall argument. The essay would benefit from a more organized approach, perhaps starting with an introduction that clearly states your argument, followed by well-structured paragraphs that each focus on a specific point.

In terms of your writing ability, I see potential, but there are definitely areas to work on. Your style is quite informal, which can be engaging, but sometimes it leads to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, ""acording"" should be spelled ""according,"" and ""did'nt"" should be ""didn't."" These small mistakes can distract the reader from your ideas. 

One of your strengths is that you seem genuinely interested in the topic, which is great! However, you might need to focus on refining your writing skills. A few recommendations would be to read more essays to see how other writers structure their arguments, and practice writing clearer sentences. It could also help to outline your ideas before writing, so you have a roadmap to follow.

To enhance your essay, consider starting with a clear thesis statement that sums up your main argument. Organize your paragraphs logically, making sure each one covers a single point with supporting details. Lastly, take the time to proofread your work carefully for spelling and grammar errors. This will help ensure your ideas shine through more clearly. Keep writing, and don’t hesitate to reach out for more help!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. There are some interesting ideas here, but they are not presented very clearly or cohesively.

First off, I think your overall impression of Luke and the Seagoing Cowgirls program comes through, which is great! You clearly have a passion for the subject and a strong connection to the character, but the essay is a bit hard to follow. You jump from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it tricky for the reader to understand your points. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your enthusiasm for the Seagoing Cowgirls program. You express a genuine interest in the experiences that come with it, like seeing the world and helping animals. However, the essay would benefit from better organization. It feels a bit like a stream of consciousness right now. Focus on structuring your thoughts with clear separate ideas—maybe each paragraph could focus on a specific aspect, like Luke's injury, her passion for animals, and her future plans. 

When it comes to evaluating your argument, I see a lot of potential! You've got a solid foundation, but it would help to include more specific examples or details to support your points. For instance, you mention that Luke likes her job and helps animals, but you could expand on that. What specific tasks does she do? What are some memorable experiences she had? Adding these details would really strengthen your argument and make it more engaging for the reader.

Looking at your writing style, I see that you have a conversational tone which is nice! However, there are many grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing that distract from your message. For example, watch out for misplaced apostrophes, like in ""like's"" and ""get's."" It's also important to check for run-on sentences. Breaking your thoughts into shorter sentences can help clarify your ideas. 

Since you seem interested in the topic of the Seagoing Cowgirls, I recommend you dig deeper into what makes the program special. You could research more about it to gather interesting facts or stories that could enhance your essay. Additionally, practicing your sentence structure and proofreading your work for grammatical errors will go a long way in improving your writing.

Overall, you have a solid start, but with some organization, attention to detail, and a bit more depth in your examples, your writing will shine. Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing more of your work!"

","I would give this essay a score of 1.5 out of 5. 

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic and how you clearly want to share your thoughts about why people might enjoy this job. It’s great to see that you’re passionate about the subject, and that shines through in your writing. However, the essay lacks clarity, and there are several areas that need improvement to effectively communicate your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is the idea that people enjoy their jobs and the potential for adventure in their work. You mention some interesting points about traveling and riding horses, which could be engaging for readers. However, the writing is quite repetitive, and many sentences are difficult to understand due to spelling and grammatical errors. It’s important to focus on organizing your thoughts clearly and ensuring that your writing flows smoothly from one idea to the next. Try to avoid repeating the same phrases and make sure each sentence adds something new to your argument.

When it comes to your argument, you show a certain passion for this job, but it would be more persuasive if you included specific examples or stories to support your claims. For instance, you mention a character who enjoys her job; it would be beneficial to elaborate on her experiences to illustrate why she loves it. This would make your argument more compelling and relatable to the reader. Also, consider addressing any potential downsides to the job, as this would create a more balanced perspective and strengthen your overall argument.

In terms of your writing ability, you have a good foundation, but there are several areas for growth. Your ideas are interesting, but the way they are presented can be confusing. Take some time to work on your spelling and grammar, as there are many mistakes that distract from your message. Using tools like spell check or asking someone to proofread your work can help catch these errors. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend practicing organizing your essays into clear sections with a beginning, middle, and end. Try to write an outline before you start, where you can jot down your main points and supporting details. This may help you stay focused and ensure that your argument is coherent. Additionally, reading more essays or articles on similar topics can give you a sense of how to structure your own writing and present your ideas more effectively.

Overall, I can see that you have a genuine interest in the topic, and with some effort, you can improve your writing skills significantly. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it!"
M-F5,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl. She is trying to tell girls that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowgirl. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowgirl. What she is saying is that she is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story she states that she went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. She says that she could go to China, and Europe on her extra time, and that she enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that she helped around the house as a young girl, and that helped her grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. She also states that she was a night watchmen, and she checked the animals every hour.

She also says that one night she was sliding downa latter on her back side and almost fell off the ship. All though she couldn't work for a few days, she satses that she was very thankful to be alive.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

","I would give your essay a score of 2.5 out of 5. 

First off, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of being a seagoing cowgirl! It’s clear that you find it interesting, and your essay reflects that passion. You’ve included some key points about the experiences shared in the passage, which is a solid foundation for your writing. However, the overall structure could use some work, and there are areas where your ideas could be more clearly expressed.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you’ve highlighted some of the exciting aspects of being a seagoing cowgirl, such as traveling to new places and having fun on board. These elements help paint a picture of what the experience could be like for young girls. However, there are quite a few areas for improvement. For instance, there are several spelling and grammatical errors, like “havig” (having), “greece” (Greece), and “satses” (states), which can be distracting for readers. Additionally, some sentences could be clearer and more concise. It would help to break down complex ideas into simpler sentences to enhance clarity.

In terms of argument and examples, you’ve touched on various experiences from the passage, but it would be great if you could delve deeper into how these experiences connect to the larger message you want to convey. For example, when you mention the character’s job and the fun activities on board, you could explain a bit more about how these experiences contribute to personal growth or empowerment for young girls. This would strengthen your argument and provide more context for your points.

When it comes to your writing competency and style, it's clear that you have ideas worth sharing, but the organization could use some work. Your essay feels a bit scattered at times, making it hard to follow your main argument. I can see that you’re interested in the topic, which is fantastic—try to channel that passion into a more structured approach. 

To improve your writing, I recommend taking the time to plan your essays before you start writing. Outline your main points and think about how you want to connect them. Don’t forget to proofread your work for spelling and grammar mistakes. Lastly, practicing writing in different styles, such as narrative or persuasive writing, can help you find your voice and improve your overall writing skills.

Overall, keep exploring your interest in this topic! With a bit more focus on clarity and structure, your writing can shine even brighter."

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Your overall impression comes through with enthusiasm for your subject, which is great! You clearly have a passion for the story of Luke Bomberger and her adventures as a seagoing cowgirl. However, the essay lacks a cohesive structure and has several grammatical mistakes that distract from your message. It feels a bit rushed, and while you share some interesting details, they could be better organized to enhance your narrative.

One of the strengths of your essay is the vivid imagery you create when describing Luke's experiences, such as her time on the ship and the games she played. It gives the reader a glimpse into her life, which is engaging! However, there are several areas for improvement. The essay needs a clear introduction and conclusion to frame your ideas. Additionally, pay attention to spelling and grammar, as errors like ""grocrey"" instead of ""grocery"" and ""cought"" instead of ""caught"" can pull readers out of the story.

When it comes to your argument and examples, you've started to explore why Luke wanted to become a seagoing cowgirl. However, it would help if you elaborated on her motivations more. What did she hope to achieve? How did her experiences shape her? Providing more context and depth would make your argument stronger and more persuasive.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show promise with your storytelling abilities. You have a unique voice, which is fantastic! But there are several weaknesses to address, such as sentence structure and clarity. Some of your sentences are fragmented or run-on, which makes it hard to follow your ideas. 

To develop further, I recommend practicing your proofreading skills. After writing, take a moment to read your essay out loud; this can help you catch errors and improve the flow of your writing. Additionally, try to outline your main points before you start writing. This will help you create a more organized structure to your essay, making it easier for your readers to understand your message.

Overall, I see a lot of potential in your writing, and I encourage you to keep working on it. With some revisions and attention to detail, you can make your essay even stronger!"
M-F7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. If you read the passege, Luke says her life was changed and she had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities she visted. Some of things she visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things she did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things she did on board. She had to get water for the horses and feed them. She also had to be a nightwatch women.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowgirls is not a bad idea. She says that it changed her life and she got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because she did the program her decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

","I’d give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Let’s dive into what you’ve written. You’ve chosen an interesting topic with the Seagoing Cowgirls program, and it’s clear you’re passionate about it. The personal touch in mentioning Luke’s experiences gives the essay a nice connection to real-life impact, which is great! However, the overall flow of your writing feels a bit disjointed, and there are several grammatical errors that detract from your message. 

One of the strengths of your essay is that you present specific examples of places Luke has visited, which helps to illustrate the benefits of the program. However, you could enhance your argument by providing more detail about why these experiences were significant for her, rather than just listing them. There are several sentences that feel incomplete or unclear, and some spelling mistakes—like ""exsperences"" and ""abourd""—that make it harder to follow your main points. 

When evaluating your argument, it seems like you agree with Luke and recognize the positive impact of the program. But I think you could strengthen your position by elaborating on how joining the program could benefit others, perhaps by including more about the skills or values one might gain. Your conclusion mentions her descendants, which is a unique angle, but it needs more clarity. How exactly does the program influence future generations? That could be a powerful point to explore further.

In terms of your writing style, you have a solid foundation, but there are areas that need attention. Your ideas are there, but they could be more organized and polished. The transitions between different sections of your essay can be smoother to create a better reading experience. Additionally, you might want to pay more attention to grammar and spelling, as these issues can distract from your argument. 

Since you seem interested in the topic, I recommend diving deeper into the specific experiences Luke had and how they shaped her perspective. Try to break down your ideas into clearer sections—perhaps introduce a point, support it with examples, and then reflect on its significance. Reading your work out loud can help catch awkward phrasing or errors that you might miss when reading silently. 

Overall, I see potential in your writing, and with some revisions, you can create a stronger and more compelling essay. Keep working on it!"
M-F8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what she thinks about what she is doing,what she thinks about her friends, and what she thinks of helping others. But I bet she would think nice things about helping people because she saide that she liked the job. And when her friend asked her if she wanted to go with her she said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it she didnt want to miss. She also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and she also liked the journey geting to Europe with her friend. Plus we would of know what she thought about the journey,the place she was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what she thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what she thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how she felt when she craked her ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that she had with her new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what she felt and thought of it. Did she like it or not. And how about her family we would of know what she thought of them. Of course she would say good things about them but still we would of know more about her thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to her because it opened her world and changed her life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what she has now.","

","I’d give your essay a score of 2.5 out of 5. You’ve got some interesting thoughts here, but there’s quite a bit of room for improvement.

First off, I appreciate your enthusiasm for exploring how the story would change if it were told from the first-person perspective. You clearly have a specific vision of what you want to convey, and that’s a great starting point! However, the overall organization of your ideas could use some work. It feels a bit scattered, and that makes it hard to follow your main points. Trying to group related thoughts together and using clearer transitions between them could really enhance the flow of your writing.

One of your strengths is that you clearly engage with the material and have a genuine interest in the topic. You also provide a lot of examples, which is great because it shows you’re thinking deeply about the character’s experiences. However, some of your examples come off as repetitive. For instance, you mention multiple times what “we would have known” if the story was in first person. Instead of reiterating that idea, try to delve deeper into fewer examples and explore them more fully. This will not only make your essay more cohesive but also strengthen your argument.

Your writing style shows potential, but there are several areas where you can improve. For one, some sentences are quite long and could be broken down for clarity. You also have a few spelling and grammatical errors, such as “saide” instead of “said” and “vollyball” instead of “volleyball.” These mistakes can distract from your message, so taking the time to proofread your work will make a big difference. Additionally, your use of informal phrases like “don’t say that I’m wrong” might not be appropriate for an essay. Try to maintain a more formal tone throughout.

Since you seem to have a strong interest in the topic, I recommend reading more essays or articles that explore similar themes. This could give you a better sense of structure and style. When you write your next draft, consider outlining your ideas first and then expanding on each point one at a time. This will help you create a more organized and compelling argument. Also, make sure to check your work for spelling and grammar before submitting it.

Overall, you have a solid foundation, and with some refinement, your writing can really shine. Keep working on organizing your thoughts and polishing your language, and I can’t wait to see how your skills develop!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Overall, I appreciate your effort in telling Luke Bomberger's story, but there are several areas that need attention for clarity and coherence. The narrative is interesting, and it feels like you have a genuine interest in the topic of World War II, which is great! However, the writing lacks organization and has numerous spelling and grammatical errors that make it challenging to follow.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you attempt to convey the experiences of Luke, giving a glimpse into her life and the challenges she faced. You include some important details about her journey, like the oceans she crossed and her experiences in training. However, the essay could benefit from clearer structure. Right now, it feels a bit like a jumble of thoughts rather than a cohesive narrative. Try to organize your ideas into paragraphs that focus on specific themes or events, which would help your readers follow along more easily.

When it comes to your argument and use of examples, I see that you are trying to illustrate Luke's experiences during the war, but the examples sometimes feel disconnected from the main points you want to make. For instance, you mention her shooting skills and her relationship with her family, but these ideas need to be better linked to the overall theme of her journey. Make sure each example you provide directly supports your main arguments or themes in the essay.

In terms of writing competency and style, your voice comes through, which is a positive aspect! However, the frequent spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing make it hard to understand what you're trying to say. For instance, ""harley remeber"" should be ""hardly remember,"" and ""discharded"" should be ""discharged."" Take time to proofread your work to catch these errors. 

While you show some strengths, like your enthusiasm for the topic, the weaknesses in spelling, grammar, and structure need to be addressed to improve your writing. I recommend spending some time reviewing basic grammar rules and practicing sentence structure. It might help to read your essay out loud to catch any confusing parts or mistakes. 

To enhance your essay, I encourage you to break it down into clearer sections. Start with an introduction that sets the stage for Luke's story, followed by paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of her journey. Make sure to revisit your work for spelling and grammatical errors. Lastly, consider adding more context to your examples so that they tie back to the main idea of your essay. This will make your writing much more effective and engaging to read. Keep going—I can see you're passionate about this topic, and with a bit of work, your writing can shine!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2.5 out of 5. 

First, let me share my overall impression. You have a great story to tell about Luke's adventure, and it's clear that you’re excited about the topic! I love how you captured the essence of trying something new and having fun, especially when it comes to surfing and seeing cool animals. However, the essay feels a bit disorganized and could benefit from clearer structure and more attention to detail. 

You’ve done well in conveying Luke's emotions and experiences, which is a strong point. I appreciate that you mentioned both Luke's excitement and the contrasting opinions of others. However, there are areas that need improvement. For one, the essay would be stronger if you focused more on sentence structure and grammar. There are several spelling mistakes (like ""definetally"" and ""excpeiorience"") and some sentences feel a bit choppy. Try to vary your sentence lengths and connect your thoughts more smoothly. 

When it comes to evaluating your argument and use of examples, you’ve got a solid foundation. You clearly explain how Luke felt at different points in her journey. However, the essay could be enhanced by providing more specific examples of the experiences she had, like what types of animals she saw or what made surfing so enjoyable for her. These details would enrich your narrative and make it more engaging for the reader. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a good sense of storytelling, but your writing needs some polishing. Strengths include your enthusiasm and the emotional connection you convey. On the other hand, weaknesses include grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors that distract from the content. 

To help you develop your writing, I recommend focusing on proofreading your work before submitting it. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and improve flow. Additionally, consider outlining your ideas before writing; this can help you create a more logical structure and ensure that your points are clear and well-connected. 

Keep working on your writing! You clearly have a passion for the topic, and with some attention to detail, I'm confident you'll improve significantly."
M-F11,"She's convincing people to be a seagoing by saying you can go to nice places. She said that one time she went to a place with streets of water. She also said it is an opportunity of a lifetime to be a seagoing. She is saying you should join the seagoings, becouse it is very nice to go to places all the way from the other side of the U.S.

She's also saying if you like taking care of animals then you should join. She talks about how her ant and her worked on a farm so that helped her out of taking care of animals, but then she says that it did not help her with the dangers of the sea. She also talks about how she gets she's ribs broken. She also says that you work for them you sometimes have to check on the animals hourly.

She tells you that her friend tolled her that she should work there, so she could not say no, because she knew it would be a life time opportunity. She tells you she would find her self having fun on borad, especially on the return trips after they droped off the anamals.

","I'm giving your essay a score of 2 out of 5. There are some interesting ideas here, but there are also quite a few issues that need addressing to make your writing clearer and more engaging.

Let’s start with the overall impression. I can see that you’re passionate about the topic of seagoing, and you have some unique experiences to share. However, the essay feels a bit scattered at times, making it hard to follow your main points. It would help to organize your thoughts more clearly so that your readers can easily understand your message.

There are definitely strengths to your writing. You include personal experiences and anecdotes, which can make your argument more relatable. The idea of seagoing as a life-changing opportunity is compelling, and the mention of different activities on board adds depth to your narrative. On the flip side, there are areas for improvement. You need to pay closer attention to spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Mistakes like ""becouse,"" ""toked,"" and ""whitch"" can distract from your message. Additionally, try to break up your paragraphs to improve readability. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea, which will help your readers follow your thoughts more easily.

When it comes to your argument, you’ve got a solid foundation, but it needs more support. You mention a friend encouraging you to join seagoing, but expanding on that story could make your argument stronger. For instance, what did your friend say that convinced you? You also touch on the hard work involved, but providing more detail about specific challenges and how you overcame them would make your case more convincing. 

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a good voice that shows your enthusiasm for the topic. However, the overall clarity of your writing can be improved. Your use of grammar and punctuation needs attention, as frequent errors can confuse your readers. Try reading your essay out loud to catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. 

You have some solid strengths, like your creativity and ability to share personal anecdotes, but you need to work on clarity and organization. A focus on spelling and grammar will also elevate your writing. 

As for recommendations, I suggest you start by outlining your essay before writing it. This way, you can organize your thoughts and ensure each paragraph has a clear focus. When you draft, don’t hesitate to go back and revise for clarity. Also, consider using tools or resources for grammar and spelling checks to catch errors before submitting. Lastly, try to incorporate more descriptive language and details into your examples to paint a clearer picture for your readers.

Overall, you’ve got an exciting topic, and with some revisions, your essay could shine! Keep up the effort, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your writing skills further."
M-F12,"The author supported her ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". She explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe she did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. She didnt just focus on one thing she focused on it all and she put her paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how she restated the question that she had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs she learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that she explained both bad and good thing about venus. She sounded like she knew exactly what she was talking about and she knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

","I would give this essay a score of 3 out of 5. There's a solid effort to engage with the topic, but the writing could use more clarity and depth in certain areas.

Overall, this essay reflects a genuine interest in the topic of Venus, and it's clear that the author has taken the time to think about both the positive and negative aspects of exploring the planet. The enthusiasm for the subject shines through, which is great! However, there are parts where the ideas could be more fully developed. While you mention both the good and bad sides of Venus, some of your points feel a bit rushed and could benefit from further explanation.

One of the strengths of your essay is how you highlight the balance between the pros and cons of Venus exploration. You effectively noted that the author of the original essay didn't just focus on one side of the argument, which is an important skill in writing. However, the essay sometimes lacks coherence. For example, some sentences could be clearer and the flow between ideas could be smoother. You mention that the ending was the best part, but it would be helpful to elaborate on why you felt that way. Giving specific examples from the text would strengthen your points.

About the argument and examples you provided, there’s a good attempt to reference specific ideas, like NASA’s compelling idea about Venus. Still, the essay would benefit from more detailed examples or evidence to support these claims. Instead of simply stating that the author did well, consider discussing how specific phrases or arguments contributed to the overall effectiveness of the essay. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the text and strengthen your analysis.

In terms of writing competency and style, there's a commendable enthusiasm in your voice, which is essential for engaging readers. However, some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing detract from the overall quality. For instance, you misspelled “explaining” and “good” in several contexts. Additionally, there’s a bit of repetition with phrases like ""she knew everything about it all,"" which can dilute the impact of your writing. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend focusing on clarity. Take the time to revise your sentences for grammar and coherence. Try to avoid vague phrases; instead, be specific about what you mean. For instance, rather than saying, “she sounded like she knew exactly what she was talking about,” explain what specific knowledge or insights made you feel that way. 

Overall, your interest in Venus and the effort you put into balancing the pros and cons is commendable. By working on clarity, coherence, and specific examples, you'll enhance your writing and make your arguments even more compelling. Keep up the great work, and don’t hesitate to dive deeper into the details next time!"

","I would give your essay a score of 3 out of 5. You’ve made a solid attempt to express your thoughts on the Seagoing Cowgirls program, but there’s definitely room for improvement in clarity and structure.

Your overall impression is quite positive. You clearly care about the topic and want to share how helping others can create connections. The idea of community involvement through programs like Seagoing Cowgirls is important, and your enthusiasm comes through. However, the essay feels a bit scattered at times, making it hard for the reader to follow your main points.

There are some strengths to highlight, particularly your passion for the subject matter. You’ve successfully communicated that being a Seagoing Cowgirl is not just about helping others; it’s also about having fun and building relationships. But there are areas you can improve on. For example, there are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message, such as ""alot"" instead of ""a lot,"" and ""convensing"" instead of ""convincing."" Focusing on these small details can make your writing much clearer.

In terms of your argument, you’ve got a good foundation, but it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples. You mention that Luke Bomberger learned a lot through the program, but you could elaborate on what those lessons were. Additionally, while you mention that Luke’s family can spread the word about the program, it would be beneficial to explain how this outreach impacts the community. This would make your argument more compelling and relatable.

Now, looking at your writing ability, you show a lot of potential. Your style is enthusiastic, which is fantastic! However, you might want to work on organizing your thoughts more coherently. Right now, the flow feels a bit choppy, and some sentences are awkwardly phrased. For instance, “In the Seagoing Cowgirls program made a big difference to her” could be rephrased for clarity. 

One of your strengths is your ability to convey emotion and excitement about the topic. Yet, a weakness lies in your attention to detail—like sentence structure and grammar—which can detract from your overall message. I’d recommend you read your work aloud or have someone else read it to catch any awkward phrases or errors.

To enhance your essay, try to focus on these specific suggestions: 

1. Proofread your work to catch typos and grammatical mistakes. Tools like spell check can help, but reading it aloud often catches errors that software may miss.
   
2. Organize your essay into clear sections. Start with an introduction that states your main point, follow with paragraphs that support that point, and conclude by summarizing your thoughts.

3. Use specific examples from the Seagoing Cowgirls program to illustrate your points. This could be stories about what activities they do or how they make a difference in people’s lives.

By incorporating these suggestions, I believe your writing will improve significantly. Keep up the good work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to brainstorm more ideas!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

First of all, I appreciate the effort you’ve put into sharing your thoughts about Luke's potential trip. It’s clear that you have a strong opinion on the matter, which is a great start. However, the overall structure and clarity of your essay could really use some improvement. Right now, it feels a bit scattered, and the reader might struggle to follow your argument.

You’ve done well to identify some reasons for and against the trip, which shows you’re thinking critically about the situation. The idea of exploring new things and taking a break is solid. But, on the flip side, the concerns about the trip feel a little vague and could use more depth. For instance, while mentioning that ""the ship can crash"" is a valid point, you might want to expand on why that’s a significant concern or how likely it really is. 

In terms of argument and examples, you have a good foundation, but your points need more elaboration. For example, when you mention exploring and learning about the environment, you could add specific things Luke might discover or learn. This would help your reader better understand the benefits of the trip. 

When it comes to writing style, you have a conversational tone that makes your essay approachable, which is great for engaging your audience. However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrases that interrupt the flow. For example, make sure to proofread for spelling mistakes like “existed” and “environment.” Furthermore, varying your sentence structure and making sure to include transitions between ideas would help your essay flow more smoothly.

Given your interest in the topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into your arguments. Try to think about what specific experiences would make the trip worthwhile or what unique opportunities could arise from it. Additionally, consider addressing the potential risks with more nuance—what safety measures might be in place? By exploring these ideas, your writing could become more persuasive and engaging.

Overall, I see a lot of potential here! Keep pushing yourself to think critically and express your ideas clearly. You’re on the right track, and with a bit more detail and polish, I believe your essays can really shine."

","I would rate this essay a 2 out of 5. While there is a compelling story at the heart of it, the writing struggles with clarity, coherence, and several grammatical issues that distract from the overall message.

To start with my overall impression, I appreciate the enthusiasm for sharing a significant moment in history, particularly post-World War II and the efforts of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It’s clear that you have an interest in this topic, and that passion can really shine through if you focus on expressing your ideas more clearly. However, the essay feels a bit scattered and lacks a strong structure, which makes it hard to follow at times.

There are definitely strengths here, particularly your choice of topic and the personal angle you’ve taken by including specific experiences. This can help engage readers. However, the essay also has notable areas for improvement. The sentences sometimes feel incomplete or run-on, and there are numerous spelling and grammar mistakes that make it difficult to understand your thoughts. For instance, “losing her grip” instead of “losed her grip,” and “August” instead of “Augast.” These errors can detract from the reader’s engagement and understanding.

In terms of your argument and the use of examples, I think you have a solid foundation. The mention of the United Nations and the specific mission gives context to your story, but it would benefit from clearer connections between ideas. For example, elaborating on how your character’s experience on the boat ties back to the broader mission of the UNRRA would strengthen your argument. Additionally, providing more details about her feelings and thoughts during those events would create a deeper emotional connection.

When evaluating your writing ability, I see potential. You have a unique voice and a clear interest in the subject matter, which is always a good starting point. However, there are weaknesses in your grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure that need addressing. I recommend practicing writing in shorter, clearer sentences and focusing on proofreading for errors. Reading your work aloud can help you catch mistakes and see where your ideas might need more clarity.

To enhance your essay, consider the following suggestions: First, work on creating an outline before you write. This can help you organize your thoughts logically and ensure each paragraph has a clear main idea. Second, pay attention to verb tenses and subject-verb agreement to improve the flow of your writing. Lastly, don’t hesitate to expand on the emotional aspects of your narrative. What was it like for her to be part of such an important mission? How did she feel about the challenges she faced? These details can make your writing more engaging and relatable.

Keep writing, and don’t be afraid to revise your work. Each draft is a step toward becoming a stronger writer!"
F1,"In this article i read about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" was about the creator of the art frew how she normally felt which was not so cheerful but more like what she's a normal act she was as half as happy as she was she always was more in a good mood more than a bad. but as i look at the art created by Leonardo da Vinci's i can tell her mood its like a slightly smile but also a i dont care type of person like she's happy but also she can careless whats going on and how things are around her that slight smile on her face shows that she's not always angry but its more of a smerk like something you do when your kinda naughty about something.

""[Essay Content: F1 / In this article i read about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" was about the creator of the art frew how she normally felt which was not so cheerful but more like what she's a normal act she was as half as happy as she was she always was more in a good mood more than a bad. but as i look at the art created by Leonardo da Vinci's i can tell her mood its like a slightly smile but also a i dont care type of person like she's happy but also she can careless whats going on and how things are around her that slight smile on her face shows that she's not always angry but its more of a smerk like something you do when your kinda naughty about something. She's giving like kinda that evil eye. In this picture it also not just about her and her actions but look around her where shes's at look like a lonely river where its a thoughtful place where she can think and for me what sets ut off is the fact that this coloring donest really have any color as much as its just a copy and the real one got a slight color to it not alot of bright out there type of color its more of a ""ehh"" type like its there but not bright like how they express her feelings shes happy therefor its there but than it dont need to be. ]""

","I’d give this essay a score of 1.5 out of 5. It shows some effort, but there are many areas that need significant improvement.

Overall, I appreciate that you’re engaging with the artwork and trying to interpret the emotions of the Mona Lisa. It’s clear you’re interested in the topic, which is great! However, the essay lacks clarity and organization. It feels a bit scattered, making it difficult for the reader to follow your thoughts. Strengthening your structure and focusing on clearer expressions of your ideas would help convey your insights more effectively.

One strength of your essay is your interpretation of the Mona Lisa’s expression. You’ve made some interesting observations about her mood and the surrounding environment, which is a good start. However, the areas for improvement are numerous. The writing needs more attention to grammar and sentence structure. For example, there are run-on sentences and unclear phrasing that can confuse the reader. Working on concise sentences and proper punctuation would greatly enhance your writing. Additionally, providing specific examples from the artwork to support your claims could make your argument much stronger.

Your argument does touch on some intriguing points about the painting's expression and mood. Still, it feels more like a stream of thoughts rather than a well-structured analysis. You might consider breaking down your ideas into smaller, more focused sections. Each paragraph could tackle a specific aspect of the painting, like her expression, the background, or the use of color. This would help guide your reader through your thoughts more clearly. 

In terms of writing ability, it’s evident that you have a passion for art, which is fantastic! However, your writing style needs refinement. There are moments where your enthusiasm shines through, but the execution falls flat due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. Remember, clarity is key. 

To improve, I recommend practicing writing in shorter sentences to make your ideas clearer. You might also try outlining your thoughts before writing to ensure a more coherent structure. Additionally, consider revisiting the artwork and taking notes on specific details that stand out to you. This could help you articulate your thoughts more effectively and provide a richer analysis.

Overall, you’re on the right track with your interest in the painting, but it’s important to focus on clarity and structure in your writing. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to seek help or resources that can guide you in refining your skills!"
F2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. She did not want to smile for the camra and so she did not she had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because she could not smile, she did not want to. That was the case she did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give her a smile. So they came up with a way and got her a smile for the photo and now she is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that she would just smile but she would not have it and so they had to give her a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want her smile so they made a program and copywrited her smile and made it fake. Like they said ""she was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. Her emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci her emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then she would be missing on things on her face. As in the mouth and her chin,nose and cheeks part of her cheeks. Like they said she was a little upset and they did not know how to get her is good mood so thomas huang created the computer that can notic emotion like as in sadness,anger,happy,nervisness,fear,disguest. All of the emotions every single one there are more emotions. So that means anybody gets there hands on this device then they can find out how anybody is felling. This device could mean the end of every thing.","

","I’d give your essay a score of 1.5 out of 5. There are some interesting ideas here, but the overall execution needs a lot of work. 

Let’s dive into my thoughts. You have a creative premise by discussing the Mona Lisa’s expression and tying it to modern technology, which is a unique angle. However, the way you’ve presented your ideas makes it hard to follow your main point. It feels a bit scattered, and there are several grammatical errors that distract from your message. I believe you have the potential to explore this topic in an engaging way, but clarity and organization will help your readers connect with your ideas better.

One of the strengths of your piece is the originality of your concept. The idea of a computer program giving the Mona Lisa a smile is intriguing and reflects a mix of art and technology, which can spark interest. However, the areas for improvement are significant. The essay lacks structure; it jumps from one thought to another without clear transitions. Additionally, there are many spelling and grammatical errors, such as “camra” instead of “camera” and “inportant” instead of “important.” Working on these aspects will help communicate your ideas more clearly. 

When it comes to the argument and examples you've used, it feels like there’s a fascinating discussion waiting to happen, but it's buried under the confusion. You mention Thomas Huang and the software he created, but you don’t provide enough context or explanation about how this relates to the Mona Lisa. Including more details about the significance of the emotions you mention and how they connect to your main idea would strengthen your argument. 

Regarding your writing ability, I can see that you’re trying to tackle a complex topic, which shows ambition. However, your writing style currently lacks clarity and coherence. You have some great ideas, but they get lost in the way they’re presented. One major weakness is the sentence structure; many sentences feel incomplete or run-on, making it difficult for readers to follow along. 

To develop your writing, I recommend practicing organizing your thoughts before you start writing. Outlining your main points can help you create a more logical flow. Also, don’t forget to proofread your work, as this will help catch those pesky spelling and grammar mistakes. Reading your essay out loud can also help you spot awkward phrases or unclear sections. Lastly, consider expanding on your ideas more fully—don’t be afraid to provide examples or explanations that connect your thoughts back to the Mona Lisa and the technology you mention.

Overall, you have the right idea, but with some revisions and more attention to detail, you could turn this into a compelling essay. Keep working on it!"
F3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Let’s dive into the overall impression first. You clearly have a strong opinion about the Mona Lisa and her expression, which is great! It shows that you're engaging with the artwork on a personal level. However, the essay reads a bit like a stream of consciousness, and it can be challenging to follow your argument. It feels like you’re jumping from one point to another without clear transitions or a structured flow, which makes it hard for the reader to grasp your main ideas.

Now, looking at strengths and areas for improvement, one strength is your ability to question common interpretations of the painting. This critical thinking is commendable, especially since you seem interested in the emotional aspects of art. However, the essay could benefit from clearer organization. Think about structuring your argument more logically—maybe start with your main point, then support it with clear examples before concluding. Additionally, pay attention to spelling and grammar; errors like ""expiriencing"" and ""dissapointed"" distract from your message.

When it comes to evaluating your argument and the use of examples, you attempt to challenge the facial feedback theory, which is an interesting angle. However, your argument would be stronger if you provided specific examples or evidence to support your claims. For instance, you could reference other artworks or studies that explore emotion in art. This would help ground your arguments and give them more weight. 

Regarding your writing ability, I can see you have a passion for the topic, which is a fantastic foundation. Your voice comes through, which is important in writing. However, the style needs refinement. The sentences are often long and could be broken down for clarity. It also seems like you were in a hurry to get your thoughts down, which is why some ideas feel underdeveloped. 

To help you develop further, I recommend taking some time to plan your essays before writing. Create an outline with your main points and supporting details. This will help you stay on track and make your writing clearer. Also, try reading your essay out loud to catch awkward phrasing or grammatical mistakes. Finally, consider exploring more about emotional expression in art through research or discussions, as it will provide depth to your arguments and enhance your understanding of the topic. 

Overall, keep nurturing your curiosity about art and emotions! You have the potential to express complex ideas; just focus on clarity and structure to bring your thoughts to life more effectively."
F4,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that she was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if she's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with her at that time of the picture you would never know how she's feeling. Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling.

","I’d give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Reading your essay, I appreciate the passion behind your argument about the limitations of the Facial Coding System in understanding emotions. It’s clear you’ve thought about the topic and have a personal perspective on it. However, there are several areas where your ideas could be presented more clearly and effectively.

One of the strengths of your essay is your conviction. You firmly believe that we can’t fully understand someone’s feelings without direct communication, and that’s an important point to make. You also touch on a famous example, the Mona Lisa, which adds a cultural reference that’s engaging. However, the essay could greatly benefit from clearer organization and stronger support for your claims. Right now, your writing feels a bit repetitive and could use more structure to guide the reader through your argument.

When it comes to your argument, you raise a valid point about the limitations of interpreting emotions through facial expressions alone. However, the examples you provide, especially regarding the Mona Lisa, could be expanded or clarified. For instance, instead of stating that we can’t know her emotions without being there, you might discuss how context—like knowing her life story—can influence our interpretation of her expression. This would strengthen your argument by providing a deeper insight into why facial coding might fall short.

In terms of writing competency, there are several areas for improvement. Your style has a conversational quality, which is great for engaging readers, but it can be a bit too informal. I noticed some grammatical errors and run-on sentences that make it hard to follow your thoughts. For instance, breaking up long sentences and ensuring proper punctuation would help clarify your message. Additionally, try to avoid using phrases like ""now"" multiple times in a single paragraph, as it can distract from your main points.

To enhance your essay, consider focusing on a clear thesis statement at the beginning, outlining your main argument. This would give your reader a roadmap for what to expect. Use more specific examples and perhaps research findings or expert opinions to support your claims, which would lend credibility to your argument. Finally, don’t forget to proofread your work for grammar and punctuation to polish your writing.

You’ve got a solid foundation here, and with some revisions, I believe you can create an even more compelling essay. Keep exploring your ideas, and I look forward to seeing how you develop them further!"
F5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

She also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, she uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

She explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing her readers that her original claim is supported.

","I would rate your essay a 3.5 out of 5. You have a solid foundation and clearly engage with the topic of exploring Venus, but there are areas where you could strengthen your argument and enhance your writing style.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject and the way you dive into the challenges of studying Venus. You've laid out the dangers effectively, and it’s clear you understand why these challenges are significant. However, the essay could benefit from a more structured approach. It sometimes feels repetitive, and refining your organization could help clarify your points. 

One of your strengths is the incorporation of specific details regarding NASA’s plans to study Venus, which add credibility to your argument. You also do well in acknowledging the challenges and addressing them, which showcases a critical understanding of the topic. On the flip side, your essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. Starting with a strong thesis statement and ending with a summary of your main points would greatly enhance the overall flow and leave a lasting impression on your reader. 

In terms of your argument and use of examples, you present a compelling case for studying Venus despite its dangers. However, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into why exploring Venus is essential beyond just the technical challenges. Incorporating broader implications of such exploration—like what we might learn about planetary science or even the origins of Earth—could make your argument even more persuasive. 

Your writing style is engaging and shows a good grasp of the subject matter, but there are areas for improvement. For example, pay attention to spelling and grammar, as there were a few typos like ""milles"" instead of ""miles"" and ""counditions"" instead of ""conditions."" These small errors can distract from your points. Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure to keep the reader engaged and to build a more dynamic writing style. 

Given your interest in this topic, I recommend diving deeper into the scientific implications of exploring Venus. Try reading more about the discoveries made from past missions and how they have shaped our understanding of the solar system. This could provide you with more material to enhance your arguments. Lastly, it might be helpful to outline your essay before you start writing to ensure a clear and logical flow from one point to the next. 

Overall, you’ve done a commendable job tackling a complex subject. Keep refining your skills, and I look forward to seeing how your writing evolves!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

First off, I want to acknowledge your effort in tackling a fascinating topic like ""Making Mona Lisa Smile Again."" It’s clear that you have some interesting ideas about the painting and the emotions it conveys. However, the essay's structure and clarity need significant improvement to effectively communicate those ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is the unique angle you take by comparing the original Mona Lisa to a computer-generated version. This is a creative approach, and it shows your ability to think outside the box. However, the overall organization of your thoughts could use some work. For instance, your paragraphs jump around a bit, making it hard to follow your argument. It’s important to have a clear structure that guides the reader through your points step by step.

When evaluating your argument, I noticed that while you mention details about how the computer model enhances the painting, you don’t fully explain why these enhancements matter. It's crucial to connect your examples back to your main point. For instance, explain how tightening her lips or adding details changes our perception of Mona Lisa and her emotions. This will strengthen your argument and make it more compelling.

Looking at your writing as a whole, I see that you have a good grasp on expressing your thoughts, but clarity and coherence are areas that need attention. You have some interesting ideas, but they get lost in the way they are presented. Try breaking down your thoughts into clearer sentences and paragraphs. Avoid run-on sentences, and make sure each one conveys a single idea. 

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic, I recommend that you read more about art analysis. This will not only give you more vocabulary to express your ideas but also help you understand how to structure your arguments more effectively. Consider outlining your essay before you start writing. This way, you can organize your thoughts and ensure that each point builds on the previous one.

To improve your essay, focus on refining your thesis statement to clearly express what you want to argue. After that, make sure each paragraph centers on a single point that supports your thesis. Use specific examples and explain them in detail, linking them back to your main idea. Lastly, proofreading your work for grammar and sentence structure will also help enhance the clarity of your writing. Keep practicing, and you will see improvement!"
F7,"The technology fro read the emotionals expressions, its something aswesome.

In this articule explain us how the computers now can check one smile and know if is a fake smile or a real smile.

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Overall, I appreciate the effort you've put into discussing the technology that reads emotional expressions. The topic is fascinating, and you’ve made a solid attempt to connect it with the famous painting of the Mona Lisa. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer structure and more attention to detail in both your ideas and writing mechanics.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you chose a compelling example with the Mona Lisa, which allows you to engage the reader’s interest. You also hint at how technology can distinguish between real and fake smiles, which is a relevant and intriguing point. However, the essay lacks clarity and coherence in places. There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that can make your ideas difficult to understand. For instance, phrases like ""the technology fro read the emotionals expressions"" and ""can be change her smile"" are confusing and need revision. 

In terms of your argument, it’s clear you are passionate about the topic, but your reasoning needs to be more developed. You mention that computers can detect emotions through facial expressions, but the explanation feels incomplete. Adding specific details or examples of how this technology works in practice would strengthen your argument. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify your conclusion; it seems to trail off without a strong closing statement that ties everything together.

As for your writing style, there are definitely some areas that need improvement. Your sentence structure is often choppy, and you have quite a few grammatical issues that hinder readability, such as subject-verb agreement mistakes and typos (like ""anotner"" instead of ""another""). On the positive side, your enthusiasm for the subject shines through, which is a valuable trait for a writer.

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on the basics of grammar and sentence structure. Reading your work out loud could help you catch awkward phrases and improve your flow. Additionally, consider creating an outline before you write to better organize your thoughts. This can help ensure that your ideas connect logically and that you fully explore each point you want to make. 

With your interest in technology and emotions, you have a great foundation. I encourage you to keep exploring this topic and to practice your writing regularly. It’s clear you have the potential to express your ideas more effectively!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

When I read your essay, I could see you have an interesting idea about the mysterious mask on Mars, and the conversation between you and Christina adds a nice personal touch. It’s great to see you exploring different viewpoints and engaging with a topic that sparks your imagination. However, there are some areas that really need attention to strengthen your writing.

One of the strengths of your essay is the enthusiasm with which you discuss the topic. Your passion for the subject shines through, and I think that’s what makes the piece engaging. However, there are several areas for improvement. First, there are quite a few grammatical errors and typos, which can distract the reader from your message. For example, “me and my partner” should be “my partner and I.” Additionally, you occasionally mix up verb tenses and have some run-on sentences, making it hard to follow your train of thought. 

In terms of your argument, you present two distinct perspectives about the mask, which is a solid starting point. However, you could enhance your argument by providing more context or evidence to support your claims. When you mention NASA's findings, it would be helpful to explain why those findings are significant in the debate about the mask. You could also elaborate on Christina’s viewpoint a bit more to give the reader a better understanding of her perspective. 

Your writing style is conversational, which can be a real asset. It makes the essay feel relatable. Yet, be mindful of clarity and coherence. Try to organize your thoughts in a way that guides the reader through your argument seamlessly. This means checking your sentence structure and ensuring that your ideas flow logically from one to the next.

Since you seem genuinely interested in the topic, I recommend taking some time to research more about Mars and how scientists study images from space. This could not only provide you with more information to strengthen your argument, but it could also inspire you to think of new angles to explore in your writing. 

Also, consider revising your essay for grammar and clarity. You might find it helpful to read it out loud or have a friend read it as well. Sometimes hearing your words can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing that you might not notice while reading silently. 

With a little more structure and attention to detail, I believe your writing can really shine! Keep exploring your ideas and working on your craft. You have a good foundation to build upon!"
F9,"I need a car! why wont you get me a car? all of my friends have cars but me, why won't you get me a car! I scream at my mother almost everyday, trying to inform her of buying me a car, but she always change the subject by saying,""look at this population, look at all these people briving, we dont need one more trying to distroy are cities"". I always ues to think in my head what is this lady talkng about, I only asked for a car.

","I’d give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. While you have a clear passion for the topic and some interesting ideas, there are several areas where you could improve both your writing and your argumentation.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm about the necessity of discussing cars and their impact on the environment. The essay has a conversational tone that makes it relatable, and it’s great to see you addressing a relevant issue. However, the essay lacks clarity and organization. It feels a bit scattered, and the grammar and spelling mistakes can distract the reader from your message. Focusing on clearer structure and editing your work would help your argument shine through more effectively.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you bring in different sources to support your points, which shows that you're engaging with research. However, the connections between your personal experiences, the sources you mention, and your main argument aren’t always clear. For example, while you reference Mr. Goldberg’s point about how much you drive being as important as owning a hybrid, you could elaborate on that further to strengthen your position. Additionally, pay attention to your spelling and grammar; words like ""biffrents"" should be corrected to ""difference"" to make your writing more polished. 

When it comes to your argument and the use of examples, there are some good ideas here, but they could be more thoroughly developed. For instance, your personal anecdote about walking with your mother is a nice touch, but it feels disconnected from the rest of your argument about cars and their environmental impact. Try to weave your personal experiences more tightly into your main points to create a more cohesive narrative. Also, make sure your examples are clearly linked to your thesis. This will help your readers follow your train of thought and understand your perspective better.

In terms of writing competency and style, you have a conversational voice that many readers will appreciate, especially as someone interested in this topic. However, your writing needs some refinement. There are frequent spelling mistakes and grammatical errors that distract from your message. For example, ""briving"" should be ""driving,"" and ""distroy"" should be ""destroy."" These small changes can make a huge difference in how your work is perceived. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend taking the time to plan your essays more carefully before you start writing. Outline your main points and how you want to connect them. After drafting, give yourself the opportunity to edit. Read your essay out loud; this can help you catch errors and awkward phrasing. Additionally, consider expanding on your arguments. Dive deeper into how reducing car usage can positively impact the environment, and don’t hesitate to use more personal anecdotes that tie back to the central theme of your essay.

Overall, you have a solid foundation to build on. With more attention to detail, organization, and clarity, I believe you can enhance your writing significantly. Keep at it!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. You've got some important ideas and a strong passion for the topic, but there are several areas where you can improve to really get your message across more effectively.

Let's start with my overall impression. Your essay tackles a critical issue—carbon emissions from vehicles—and it’s clear that you care about the environment. That enthusiasm is great, and it’s important when discussing such a pressing topic. However, the essay struggles with clarity and organization, making it hard for readers to follow your argument.

In terms of strengths, your passion shines through, and you provide some interesting suggestions, like banning cars on certain days and promoting biking. These ideas show your creativity and concern for the planet. On the other hand, there are several areas needing improvement. For one, your spelling and grammar need serious attention. Words like ""vehicals,"" ""artical,"" ""nesesity,"" ""differnce,"" and ""emmisons"" distract from your message. Additionally, some sentences are run-on and need to be broken up for clarity. Organizing your thoughts more logically would also help your argument flow better.

When it comes to your argument and the use of examples, you do offer some potential solutions, like carpooling and using hybrid vehicles, which is good. However, more concrete examples and data would strengthen your points. For instance, citing statistics or studies about the impact of emissions or successful biking initiatives in cities could help to make your case more convincing. 

Now, regarding your writing ability, you have a solid foundation, but you definitely need to work on your writing style. The essay feels a bit rushed, and the errors in spelling and grammar detract from your overall message. Strengths include your creative ideas and engagement with the topic, but weaknesses lie in structure, clarity, and mechanics.

To help you develop, I recommend focusing on a few key areas. First, take the time to proofread your work. Reading it out loud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrases. Second, think about outlining your main points before you start writing, which will help you organize your thoughts coherently. Finally, consider incorporating more research or factual information, as this will not only support your argument but also demonstrate your understanding of the topic.

With your interest in environmental issues, I can see you have the potential to write impactful essays. Keep working on these skills, and your writing will definitely improve!"

","I’d give this essay a score of 1 out of 5. It lacks clarity and structure, which makes it difficult to follow your argument. 

Let’s dive into my overall impression. You clearly have strong feelings about the topic, which is great! However, the way you express those feelings needs some work. Right now, your thoughts seem a bit scattered, and the overall message gets lost in the jumble of words. It’s important to organize your ideas so that readers can follow your reasoning more easily.

One of the strengths of your essay is your passion. You definitely care about the subject, and your voice comes through loud and clear. But this can also be a double-edged sword. While emotion can make writing engaging, it needs to be balanced with clear reasoning and structure. A significant area for improvement lies in your use of punctuation and grammar. Many sentences are run-ons, which makes them hard to read. Additionally, avoiding slang and informal language will help your writing come across as more polished.

When it comes to your argument, it feels a bit disjointed. You raise valid points about the irrelevance of past emotions, but you don’t offer enough examples or context to strengthen your argument. For instance, referencing specific historical figures or artworks could help solidify your claims about emotions in art. Instead of just saying “who cares,” you could frame it more thoughtfully by discussing why understanding emotions in art might matter—or why it doesn’t to you. This would show a deeper engagement with the topic.

In terms of your writing ability, I see potential, but there’s a lot of room for growth. Your style is conversational, which can be engaging, but it needs to be more focused and structured. Currently, your strengths lie in your passion and voice, but your weaknesses include grammar, coherence, and clarity. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend starting with an outline before you write. This way, you can organize your thoughts and ensure that each point you make supports your main argument. Additionally, focusing on sentence structure and punctuation will improve readability. Finally, try to incorporate examples or references that back up your claims. This will not only make your writing stronger but will also show that you’ve thought critically about the topic.

I can see that you’re interested in expressing your thoughts on this topic, and that’s a fantastic starting point! Keep pushing yourself to refine your ideas and how you communicate them. With some practice and attention to structure and clarity, you'll be able to convey your passion more effectively."

","I would assign your essay a score of 2 out of 5. You show an interesting perspective on the emotions of the Mona Lisa and the use of technology to interpret feelings, but there are several areas that need improvement.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic and the unique angle you’ve taken by linking the Mona Lisa with modern technology. It’s clear you’re engaged with the subject matter, which is a great starting point. However, the essay lacks clarity and organization, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow your ideas. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your attempt to connect the emotions of the Mona Lisa with modern technological advancements in understanding feelings. This concept is intriguing and shows that you are thinking deeply about the implications of emotion recognition technology. However, the essay has some significant weaknesses, particularly in grammar, spelling, and structure. There are numerous typos and grammatical errors that distract from your message, and the flow of your arguments needs to be clearer. For example, the transitions between your thoughts can be jarring, making it hard for the reader to grasp the connection between your points.

When evaluating your argument, I can see that you bring in relevant ideas about emotions and how they are perceived. However, the examples you use, such as the statistics about the Mona Lisa’s emotions, are not clearly explained or referenced in a way that strengthens your argument. It would help if you provided more context around these statistics and made clearer connections between your points. Additionally, while you mention Ekman’s classification of emotions, it would be beneficial to elaborate on that concept more, perhaps by explaining how it relates to the Mona Lisa or how it ties back to your main argument about technology.

In terms of your writing ability, you have some strong ideas, but the execution needs work. Your style is conversational, which can be engaging, but it sometimes leads to unclear sentences. For instance, phrases like ""everyone believed that there was gonna be this system to figure out how people were gonna react"" could be refined for clarity. 

To improve, I recommend focusing on a few key areas. First, work on your sentence structure and grammar. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch awkward phrases and typos. Second, try to create an outline before writing to help organize your thoughts; this will make your argument clearer and easier to follow. Lastly, consider supporting your ideas with more specific examples and explanations. For instance, when you mention Ekman, take a moment to explain who he is and why his work matters in the context of your essay.

Overall, I can see that you have a genuine interest in the topic, and with some focused effort on clarity and structure, your writing can become much stronger. Keep exploring these ideas, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need help refining your work!"
F13,"By limiting car use not only does it help monther earth, by extracting all thoes harmful chemicals in the air.

","I’d give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. You’ve got some interesting ideas, but there are quite a few areas that need work to make your argument clearer and more persuasive. 

Overall, I appreciate the passion behind your argument about limiting car use and its benefits for the environment. You raise some important points, especially regarding the impact of cars on greenhouse gases. However, the essay feels a bit disorganized and could benefit from clearer structure and more precise language. There are also several grammatical errors that detract from your message. 

On the positive side, your enthusiasm shines through, and you present a relatable perspective on how life without cars could be more peaceful. The reference to the woman from Germany is a nice touch, as it adds a personal element to your argument. However, you could strengthen your essay by providing more concrete examples and statistics to back up your claims. For instance, mentioning specific studies or data about air quality improvements in car-free towns would make your argument more compelling. Additionally, there were a few typos and grammatical issues, like ""monther"" instead of ""mother,"" and ""amense"" instead of ""immense,"" which need attention. 

When considering your writing ability, it's clear that you have a good grasp of the topic, especially if you're interested in it. Despite this, your writing could use more polish. Your vocabulary is decent, but you might want to work on sentence structure to enhance clarity and flow. Some of your sentences are quite long and could be broken up to improve readability. On the flip side, your informal tone makes your writing feel accessible, which is a strength. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend focusing on organizing your thoughts before you start writing. Creating an outline can help you arrange your ideas logically and ensure each point flows into the next. Additionally, proofreading your work or using tools like spell-check can help catch those pesky typos. Consider also expanding your research to include more examples to support your claims, which will strengthen your argument significantly.

In summary, you have a solid foundation here, but with a bit of restructuring and attention to detail, your essay can evolve into a much stronger piece. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to ask for help along the way!"

","I would give your essay a score of 1.5 out of 5. It’s clear that you’re expressing some strong feelings about technology and emotions, but there are several areas that need improvement for your writing to be more effective. 

First off, I appreciate your passion for the topic. You’re raising a thought-provoking question about whether new technologies should involve our emotions. It’s a sensitive subject, and I can tell you care about the implications it has on people's feelings. However, the overall structure and clarity of your essay make it difficult for your points to shine through. 

One of the strengths of your essay is that you are attempting to engage with the article and provide your perspective. The use of personal feelings and opinions adds a layer of authenticity to your writing. However, the essay lacks clear organization and development. For example, your sentences often feel incomplete or unclear, making it challenging to follow your argument. You also have several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. Focus on proofreading your work to catch these mistakes. 

In terms of argument and examples, your essay could be improved significantly. You mention how technology might affect people’s feelings but don’t provide a strong, clear example of what you mean. While you reference the article, it would help if you elaborated on specific points and connected them more directly to your personal views. For instance, you mention a lady in a picture but don’t explain why her expression matters in the context of your argument. Strengthening your examples will help support your claims and make your essay more persuasive. 

Looking at your writing ability, it’s clear that you’ve got some ideas worth sharing, but the execution needs work. The main weaknesses lie in sentence structure, grammar, and clarity. You want your readers to understand your viewpoint, so strive for clearer language and organization. 

To develop your writing further, I recommend spending a little extra time on planning before you start writing. Outlining your main points can help you create a more coherent flow. Also, don’t hesitate to ask someone to read your essay before you submit it. They might catch errors you missed or offer insights on how to express your ideas more effectively. Reading your work out loud can also help identify awkward phrases or unclear sentences. 

In summary, your enthusiasm for the topic is a fantastic foundation. Consider focusing on clarity, structure, and supporting your arguments with specific examples. You have the potential to create a compelling essay—keep working on it!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

I appreciate the effort you've put into discussing the Facial Action Coding System and its implications for understanding emotions. It's clear you have an interest in the topic, which is a great starting point. However, the essay feels a bit disorganized, and some of your ideas need more clarity and support. 

One of the strengths of your essay is that you’re tackling an interesting and relevant subject. The idea that technology can both help and hinder emotional understanding is a valuable point. However, the flow of your argument could be improved. For instance, the introduction could be clearer in stating your main thesis. Additionally, some sentences are hard to follow due to grammar and spelling issues, which distract from your argument. 

Your argument has potential, especially when you discuss how the technology might affect people who are reluctant to share their emotions. However, it would benefit from more detailed examples or evidence to back up your claims. The reference to the Mona Lisa is intriguing, but it could be developed further to illustrate your point more effectively. Consider exploring how facial expressions might not fully capture complex human emotions, rather than just stating percentages. 

When it comes to writing style, there are several areas to work on. Your ideas are interesting, but some sentences are quite choppy and could be more fluid. Pay attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation—these aspects are crucial for making your writing clearer and more professional. For example, words like ""somebody"" and ""easier"" were misspelled, which can undermine your credibility. 

You show a lot of potential with your insights, but you need to focus on refining your writing skills. I suggest reading through your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing and grammatical errors. Additionally, consider outlining your main points before you begin writing to help organize your thoughts more clearly. It might also be helpful to read more essays or articles on similar topics to see how they structure their arguments and support their claims. 

Overall, it’s great to see your passion for the topic, and with some revisions and attention to detail, your writing can really shine! Keep at it!"

","It's clear you've put some thought into your essay about the ""Mona Lisa"" and the emotions behind it. I appreciate your effort to analyze Leonardo da Vinci's work and the feelings you perceive through the painting. However, there are several areas we could work on to strengthen your writing.

First of all, your overall impression of the painting's subject and mood is interesting, but it feels a bit scattered. You have some captivating ideas, but they need to be presented in a clearer and more organized manner. The flow of your thoughts can be hard to follow, which makes it difficult for the reader to grasp your main points. A little more structure could really elevate your essay.

One of the strengths of your writing is that you’re trying to connect Leonardo’s mood with the painting’s emotional expression. This shows a deeper level of engagement with the subject. However, there are areas that need improvement. For instance, the grammar and punctuation could be polished. Using complete sentences and proper punctuation will help your thoughts come across more clearly. Additionally, you might want to elaborate on your points more. For example, when you discuss the ""slightly smile,"" you could explain how this impacts the viewer's interpretation of the painting. 

In terms of argument and examples, while you touched on some intriguing ideas, they didn’t feel fully developed. You mention the ""lonely river"" and the colors in the painting, but these points could be expanded upon. What specifically about the river contributes to the mood? How does the lack of color influence your understanding of the artwork? Providing more concrete examples and connecting them back to your central argument would strengthen your analysis significantly.

Now, regarding your writing ability, I can see that you have potential. You have a unique voice, and your personal reflections add a nice touch. However, it would help if you focused on clarity and coherence. Right now, some of your sentences are a bit jumbled, making it harder for the reader to follow your line of thought. It’s essential to make sure each sentence contributes to your overall message. 

To develop your skills further, I recommend practicing writing in clearer, more structured formats. Try outlining your thoughts before you start writing. This can help you stay focused on your main ideas and ensure that each part of your essay flows logically into the next. Also, consider reading more essays or articles on similar topics to see how other writers construct their arguments and use examples effectively.

In conclusion, you have a solid foundation to build on. Taking the time to refine your ideas, improve your sentence structure, and develop your arguments with more detail will greatly enhance your writing. Keep exploring your thoughts on art, and don’t hesitate to dig deeper into your analysis. You're on the right track; just keep pushing yourself to express those ideas more clearly!"
F-M2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery.

That was the case he did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give his a smile. So they came up with a way and got his a smile for the photo and now he is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that he would just smile but he would not have it and so they had to give his a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want his smile so they made a program and copywrited his smile and made it fake.

","I'd give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

You’ve tackled a fascinating topic with the Mona Lisa and the idea of digitally altering her smile, which shows creativity and a unique perspective. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The essay lacks clarity and coherence, making it challenging to follow your argument or understand the main points you’re trying to convey. 

One of the strengths of your writing is that you’re clearly passionate about the subject, which is great to see! You introduce some interesting concepts, like the digital manipulation of emotions and the role of technology in art. However, the organization of your thoughts needs significant improvement. Many sentences are confusing and have grammatical errors, which detracts from your overall message. For example, phrases like ""he did not want to smile for the camra"" could be clearer and more precise. Additionally, some words are misspelled, such as ""softwear"" instead of ""software,"" and punctuation is often missing or incorrect, which can confuse your readers.

When discussing the Mona Lisa and the technology behind the smile, it would help to provide clearer connections between your ideas and more structured arguments. You mention Thomas Huang and the technology, but it feels a bit scattered. Instead of jumping from one thought to another, try to group related ideas together and provide smoother transitions. Using specific examples can also strengthen your argument; for instance, explaining how the software works or providing more background on Leonardo da Vinci's intentions would be beneficial. 

In terms of writing competency, your enthusiasm shines through, but your style needs refining. Sentences often feel choppy and fragmented, making it hard for readers to grasp your points. There are also numerous spelling and grammatical errors that need to be addressed. It’s great that you’re exploring a sophisticated topic, but you’ll want to focus on presenting your ideas more clearly and effectively.

To enhance your essay, consider these specific suggestions: 

1. Start with a strong thesis statement that clearly outlines your main argument about the Mona Lisa and the digital alterations. This will help guide your writing and keep your ideas focused.

2. Organize your essay into clear paragraphs, each with a main idea that supports your thesis. This structure will make it easier for readers to follow your thoughts.

3. Pay attention to grammar and spelling. Proofreading your work or using tools can help catch errors that distract from your content.

4. Use more specific examples to back up your points. For instance, how does the technology actually analyze emotions? Providing details will make your argument more convincing.

5. Finally, practice writing more regularly. The more you write, the better you'll become at organizing your thoughts and expressing them clearly. 

Keep at it! With some focused effort on clarity and structure, I believe your writing can improve significantly."
F-M3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. You're engaging with an interesting topic, but the execution needs some work. 

Overall, I appreciate your effort to analyze the emotions expressed in the Mona Lisa. You’ve brought in an intriguing perspective that challenges the conventional interpretations of this famous painting. It’s clear you have a personal connection to the subject, which is great for engaging readers. However, the essay feels a bit unfocused at times, and the argument could be more clearly structured. 

One of the strengths of your essay is your willingness to question established interpretations, which is a vital aspect of critical thinking. You make some valid points about how emotions can be difficult to read and how context can change our perception. However, you also need to improve the organization of your thoughts. At times, your sentences feel run-on and could benefit from clearer punctuation and structure. Additionally, the spelling and grammatical errors (like “expiriencing” instead of “experiencing” and “dissapointed” instead of “disappointed”) distract from your argument. 

In terms of your argument and examples, you raise important points about the limitations of facial feedback theory and the ambiguity of emotions. However, your references to the artwork could be more detailed and contextualized. For instance, discussing more about the historical background of the painting or the artist's intentions could strengthen your position. Providing specific examples from other artworks or emotions might also enhance your argument and make it more compelling.

When it comes to your writing style, I can see that you have a natural voice, but it could benefit from a bit more polish. Your ideas are interesting, but the clarity and flow of your writing need attention. For example, aim to break your thoughts into clearer sentences and paragraphs, which will help guide your reader through your argument. 

I recommend focusing on a few key areas for development: first, work on your sentence structure and grammar. Take the time to proofread your work to catch those small mistakes. Next, consider creating an outline before you write. This can help you organize your thoughts and make sure each point flows logically into the next. Lastly, try to incorporate more evidence to back up your claims, like discussing the art’s historical significance or other interpretations of the Mona Lisa. 

Keep up your curiosity about the topic. With some refinement in your writing process, your insights could shine even brighter!"
F-M4,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that he was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if he's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with his at that time of the picture you would never know how he's feeling. Thats probably how he takes all of his pictures you never know, he could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with his at that time of the painting andd he told you how he was feeling.

","I’d give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. While you clearly have strong feelings about the Facial Coding System, there’s room for improvement in how you present your ideas and support your arguments.

Let’s talk about your overall impression. You definitely express a solid viewpoint – questioning the effectiveness of technology in understanding emotions is a valid and intriguing topic. However, the essay feels a bit scattered, which makes it hard to follow your train of thought. A clearer structure would help the reader understand your argument better.

One of the strengths in your writing is your passion for the subject. You seem genuinely interested in understanding human emotions and the limitations of technology. However, you need to work on organizing your thoughts more clearly. Right now, your points come across as a bit jumbled. It would be beneficial to break your essay into paragraphs, with each one focusing on a single idea. This will make your argument stronger and easier to follow. Additionally, watch out for spelling and grammar errors, like “perent,” which should be “percent,” and “andd,” which should be “and.” These little mistakes can distract from your message.

When it comes to evaluating your argument and the examples you use, I think there’s potential for more depth. You mention the Mona Lisa painting, which is a good start, but it would be even stronger if you elaborated on that example or included other instances. Think about how you could incorporate more evidence or reasoning to support your view. For instance, you might explore why relying solely on facial expressions can be misleading or discuss the context in which emotions are displayed.

Now, looking at your writing ability overall, I can see that you have a good foundation, but there's significant room for growth. Your voice comes through, which is great, but the flow of your writing needs work. One recommendation would be to practice writing in paragraphs, which will help you develop your ideas more cohesively. Also, consider reading more essays or articles on similar topics to see how other writers structure their arguments and use examples.

Since you seem interested in this topic, I encourage you to dive deeper into research about facial coding and emotional recognition. This could provide you with more insights and examples, which would enrich your argument. Additionally, try revising your essay by outlining your main points before writing. This way, you can ensure that each part of your argument connects logically to the next.

To enhance your essay, start by creating a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Make sure each paragraph focuses on one main idea and includes examples or reasoning to support it. Pay attention to grammar and spelling, as these aspects matter in conveying your message effectively. Lastly, don’t hesitate to explore multiple perspectives—consider what proponents of the Facial Coding System might say and address those points to show that you’ve thought critically about the topic. This will not only strengthen your argument but also demonstrate your engagement with the subject. Keep working at it!"
F-M5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

He also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, he uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

He explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, he was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing his readers that his original claim is supported.

","I would give this essay a score of 3 out of 5. 

Overall impression: You’ve tackled a fascinating topic with a clear stance on the value of studying Venus, and that’s a great starting point. Your essay shows that you’re engaged with the material, and it’s clear you understand the challenges involved in exploring Venus. However, the structure and clarity of your arguments could use some refinement to make your points more compelling and easier to follow.

Strengths and areas for improvement: One of the strengths of your essay is how you recognize the dangers of Venus while still advocating for exploration. You present the duality of the risks and rewards well. However, some areas need attention. For example, the essay could benefit from clearer transitions between your points, which would help guide the reader through your argument. Additionally, ensure that your paragraphs maintain a consistent focus—some of your points seem a bit scattered, which can distract from your main argument.

Evaluating your argument and use of examples, you have a good foundational understanding of the challenges presented by Venus. You used specific examples, like NASA's plans, to illustrate your points, which is excellent. However, integrating more of these examples with greater detail or context would strengthen your argument even further. For instance, explaining why NASA’s technology is significant in more depth would enrich your analysis. 

Looking at your writing ability, you show a solid grasp of the topic, suggesting you are either interested or somewhat experienced in this field. Your enthusiasm for the subject shines through, which is a strength. On the other hand, you should work on sentence structure and coherence. Some sentences feel a bit awkward or too complex; simplifying your language can enhance clarity. 

To improve your essay, consider creating a stronger thesis statement at the beginning that encapsulates your main argument. It would also be helpful to outline your points before writing, allowing for a more logical flow. When you present examples, connect them back to your overall argument more explicitly, reinforcing how they support your thesis. Lastly, proofreading for spelling and grammatical errors, like ""milles"" instead of ""miles,"" will make your essay appear more polished. 

Overall, you’ve made a solid start, and with some focused revisions, you can elevate your essay to be more impactful and persuasive. Keep exploring your ideas, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into the examples that excite you!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. There are some interesting ideas here, but the clarity and structure really need work. 

Overall, I appreciate your effort to engage with the topic of the Mona Lisa and the idea of the computer-generated version of her smile. It's clear that you're trying to explore the nuances of the artwork and how technology can enhance it, which is a fascinating angle. However, I found it difficult to follow your argument at times. The essay feels a bit disjointed, and that makes it hard for the reader to grasp your main points.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you have a clear topic you want to discuss. You also touch on some important aspects, like the emotional expression in the painting, which is really relevant. However, your writing would benefit from some clearer organization. Right now, your paragraphs seem to jump around without strong connections, making it challenging to understand your main argument. Focusing on a more structured approach—where each paragraph builds on the last—would help your readers follow your thoughts more easily.

When it comes to your argument and the use of examples, I see potential, but they need to be clearer and more detailed. For instance, you mention “paragraph 2” and “paragraph 7,” but it would help to summarize or quote key points from those sections to strengthen your argument. Right now, it feels like you're referencing parts of the text without really pulling the reader in to understand why those parts are significant. 

Regarding your writing style, it’s evident that you have a lot of enthusiasm for the subject, which is great! However, the sentence structure and clarity pose challenges. There are various grammatical and spelling errors—like ""agian"" instead of ""again,"" and ""accomplishing"" instead of ""accomplishing""—that detract from your writing. Taking the time to proofread and correct these would strengthen your essay significantly. 

To improve, I recommend outlining your essay before writing. Start with a clear thesis statement, then plan your paragraphs around specific points that support that statement. Also, try to develop each idea fully before moving on to the next. If you're interested in this topic, consider diving deeper into the emotional aspects of the art itself. What does Mona Lisa’s smile mean to you? How does the technology change or enhance that meaning? By asking these questions, you can create a more compelling narrative that resonates with your readers.

Overall, your passion for the topic is clear, and with some focused revisions and a stronger structure, you can create a truly engaging and insightful essay about the Mona Lisa and her smile. Keep at it!"

","I would give your essay a score of 2 out of 5. It shows an interesting idea about technology and emotion recognition, but there are several areas where you can improve clarity and coherence.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the topic of emotional expression and technology. You brought in a fascinating example with the Mona Lisa, which many people can relate to. However, the writing feels a bit disorganized and some sentences are hard to follow. It’s important to have a clear structure in your essay so that your readers can easily grasp your ideas.

One of the strengths of your essay is the choice of examples, especially the mention of the Mona Lisa and the idea of recognizing emotions through facial expressions. That’s a great way to connect technology to something culturally significant. On the other hand, there are quite a few grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward phrases that detract from your message. For instance, ""fro read the emotionals expressions"" and ""can be change his smile"" need some revision for clarity and correctness. It would help to proofread your work or have someone else read it before submitting.

Your argument about how computers can distinguish between real and fake smiles is a compelling point, but it could be developed further. Providing more details about how this technology works or including a specific study or example would strengthen your argument. You mentioned that humans can read emotions too, which is a good observation, but it would be even better if you tied that back to the technology you're discussing.

In terms of writing ability, you're clearly interested in this topic, which is fantastic! Your passion shows through, but the execution needs some work. You have a good foundation, but focusing on sentence structure, grammar, and spelling will make your writing much stronger. 

To enhance your essay, I recommend taking the time to revise your sentences for clarity. For example, instead of saying ""In this articule explain us how the computers now can check one smile,"" you might say, ""This article explains how computers can analyze smiles to determine if they are genuine or fake."" Also, consider breaking up some of the longer sentences to improve readability. 

Finally, it might be useful to include a conclusion that not only summarizes your main points but also reflects on the implications of this technology—like how it could change the way we interact with one another. Keep working on your writing, and I look forward to seeing how you develop your ideas in the future!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

Overall, I appreciate the creative approach you took by imagining a scenario involving a mysterious mask on Mars. It’s clear that you’re interested in the topic, which is great because it helps make your writing more engaging. However, the essay feels a bit disorganized, and there are several areas where clarity and structure could be improved. 

One of the strengths of your essay is the imaginative premise. You’ve introduced an intriguing concept with the idea of a mask on Mars, which definitely grabs attention. The dialogue between you and Christina also adds some personality to your writing, making it feel more like a story. On the downside, there are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that distract from your main ideas. For example, phrases like “me and my partner Christina was” should be corrected to “my partner Christina and I were.” Additionally, the flow of your argument needs work, as it jumps around a bit. 

Regarding your argument and the use of examples, I see that you started with a strong premise about the mask but didn’t fully develop your thoughts. You mentioned the NASA image, which is a fantastic reference, but it would be helpful if you elaborated on why that image is significant and how it supports your argument against the idea of aliens. Right now, it feels like a summary rather than a detailed analysis. 

Looking at your writing style, it shows potential, yet there are significant areas for growth. Your voice shines through, which is important, but your sentences often lack the necessary clarity. The informal tone is fine for a narrative, but be careful about spelling errors and grammar – they can create confusion. For instance, words like ""obivious"" and ""Christna"" need to be corrected to maintain professionalism. 

To develop your writing skills further, I would recommend focusing on creating a clear outline before writing. This can help you organize your ideas better and ensure that each point flows logically into the next. Additionally, practice proofreading your work for grammar and spelling errors. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch awkward phrases and make your writing sound more natural. 

Overall, your enthusiasm for the topic is evident, but with some revisions and a clearer structure, your essay could be much stronger. Keep pushing yourself to refine your ideas and express them clearly, and you’ll see great improvement!"
F-M9,"I need a car! why wont you get me a car? all of my friends have cars but me, why won't you get me a car!

","I’m giving your essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

First off, I appreciate your enthusiasm and the personal touch in your writing. You clearly have strong feelings about wanting a car, and that passion comes through, which is great! I think that personal connection can really engage readers. However, the overall organization and clarity of your essay could use some work. It’s a bit scattered right now, making it challenging for readers to follow your main points. 

One of the strengths of your essay is that you touch upon important issues like environmental impact and traffic congestion, which are relevant topics today. However, your arguments sometimes feel disjointed. For instance, you jump from personal anecdotes to statistics without smooth transitions, which can confuse your reader. It would help to clearly connect your personal experiences with the broader arguments you’re making about cars and their impact on society. 

When you present your examples, like the statistics on greenhouse gas emissions and the anecdote about walking with your dad, it’s important to tie them back to your main point. You mention Mr. Goldberg’s quote, but you could explain more about why that matters in your argument. This would strengthen your case and help your reader understand your perspective better. Instead of just stating facts or personal stories, try to analyze them a bit more.

As for your writing style, there are several grammatical errors and typos that distract from your message. For example, “briving” should be “driving,” and “distroy” should be “destroy.” These kinds of mistakes can take away from the seriousness of your argument. I suggest proofreading your work or using a spell-check tool before submitting it. Additionally, your use of punctuation could be improved; some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for clarity.

Given your interest in the topic, I think you have a lot of potential! To develop your writing further, consider focusing on one main idea per paragraph and building your arguments around that. Try to use clear topic sentences that guide your reader through your thoughts. Also, practice varying your sentence structure to keep things interesting. Engaging with more structured essays or articles on similar topics might also help you see how to better organize your ideas.

Overall, you have the foundation of a compelling essay, but with some revisions and attention to detail, you can make your argument much stronger. Keep writing and revising; I’m looking forward to seeing how you grow!"

","I would give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. While the topic is important and relevant, the writing itself needs significant improvement. 

Overall, I appreciate your passion for environmental issues and your desire to promote a more sustainable lifestyle. It's clear that you have strong feelings about the impact of vehicles on our planet, and that passion is essential in persuasive writing. However, the essay struggles with organization, clarity, and numerous grammatical issues that make it difficult to follow your argument.

One of the strengths of your writing is your commitment to the topic. You present some compelling ideas, such as the suggestion to ban cars on certain days and the importance of promoting alternative transportation. However, the essay could benefit from clearer structure. Right now, your ideas feel a bit scattered. Try organizing your thoughts into clear paragraphs, each focusing on a single point. This will help your reader understand your argument better. Additionally, there are spelling errors and grammatical mistakes throughout, which distract from your message. For example, ""vehicals"" should be ""vehicles,"" and ""differnce"" should be ""difference."" Proofreading your work before submitting it would help catch these mistakes.

In terms of your argument, you have some interesting points about reducing carbon emissions, but they could be developed further. For instance, when you mention building cities closer together, it would strengthen your argument to include examples of cities that have successfully implemented this idea. Also, consider discussing the pros and cons of hybrid vehicles a bit more. This will show that you've thought critically about the issue and can present a well-rounded argument.

Your writing style shows potential, but it needs refining. While your enthusiasm is evident, the essay's flow is disrupted by frequent spelling errors and awkward phrasing. For instance, ""earth is the father of all life"" is a powerful metaphor, but the way it's presented can become confusing, especially with grammatical errors. Focus on varying your sentence structure and ensuring you're using correct punctuation, which will make your writing clearer and more engaging. 

Since you seem genuinely interested in environmental issues, I encourage you to read more essays or articles on this topic. Pay attention to how they structure their arguments and support their points with evidence. This will help you develop your own writing style. Additionally, consider working on your proofreading skills. It might be helpful to read your essay out loud or have someone else read it to catch mistakes you might miss.

In summary, keep exploring your ideas about protecting the environment, but take the time to organize your thoughts clearly and refine your writing. You have a strong foundation to build on, and with some practice, your writing can become more persuasive and impactful."

","This essay presents a passionate perspective, but it ultimately struggles to convey a coherent argument. I would assign it a score of 1 out of 5. 

Your overall impression comes through loud and clear—you feel frustrated with the idea of analyzing someone's mood from the past. That’s a strong emotion, and it gives your writing a personal touch, but it can also make it hard for readers to follow what you’re trying to say. The tone is conversational, which can engage readers, but the points you're making get lost in the chaos of your thoughts. It feels like a stream of consciousness rather than a structured argument.

One of the strengths of your essay is your authentic voice; it shines through in the way you express your feelings about the topic. However, the lack of organization really detracts from your message. You jump from one idea to another without clear connections, which can confuse readers. It would help to slow down and think about how you can structure your thoughts more clearly. Consider starting with a thesis statement that outlines your main argument, then follow that with supporting details in a logical order.

When it comes to evaluation of your argument, there are some interesting points in there, especially about the nature of past emotions and the relevance of historical context. However, your examples often feel scattered and don't connect back to your main point. For instance, when you mention the Mona Lisa, it's a compelling reference, but it could use more context to explain why that matters to your argument. Grounding your opinions in specific examples or cases will help make your argument more persuasive and relatable.

Looking at your writing ability, it’s clear you have strong feelings about the topic, and that’s a great start! Your style is informal and engaging, but it would be beneficial to work on sentence structure and clarity. Right now, your writing tends to be a bit chaotic, which might distract readers from your main points. Practicing with outlines could really help you organize your ideas before diving into writing.

To enhance your essay, start by drafting a clear thesis statement that summarizes your main argument. Then, create an outline, organizing your ideas into a logical flow. When you write, try to stick to one main idea per paragraph and support that idea with examples or reasoning. This will make your writing more coherent and impactful. Finally, remember to proofread for grammar and clarity; small errors can distract from your message. With some focused practice, I’m confident you can improve and express your thoughts even more effectively!"
F-M12,"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent man. we all kmow he was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked his if he was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

","I would score this essay a 2 out of 5. It shows an attempt to engage with an interesting topic, but there are significant areas needing improvement in terms of clarity, coherence, and structure.

Overall, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the subject matter, especially regarding how technology can help us understand emotions. You clearly have some interesting thoughts about the Mona Lisa and emotional expression, but the way you’ve presented them makes it hard to follow your ideas. It feels a bit disjointed at times, and there are numerous grammatical errors that distract from your message.

One strength of your essay is that you touch on a complex topic—the intersection of emotion and technology—which could resonate with many readers. However, there are many areas for improvement. For one, your sentences often lack clear structure, making it difficult to understand your points. Additionally, you have a few spelling errors and typos that hinder the readability of your work. For example, ""technologly"" should be ""technology,"" and ""reson"" should be ""reason."" Paying attention to these details will make your writing much clearer.

When it comes to your argument, it feels like you have a strong starting point, but it needs more development. You mention the six basic emotions according to Ekman, which is great, but you don’t delve deeply into how this relates to the Mona Lisa or the broader implications of emotional technology. You could strengthen your argument by providing more specific examples or sources that support your claims. The mention of Nicu Sebe was interesting, but it needed more context to connect it back to your main points.

In terms of your writing ability, I can see that you have the potential to express your ideas well. Your voice comes through, which is a great start, but you need to work on organizing your thoughts more clearly. Right now, your essay jumps around a bit, which can confuse readers. Focus on creating smooth transitions between your ideas so that one flows into the next logically.

To develop your writing further, try outlining your essay before you start writing. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that each paragraph has a clear focus. Additionally, consider revising your work for grammar and punctuation. Reading your essay out loud can also help you catch errors and awkward phrasing. Finally, try to expand on your ideas more fully. Instead of just stating your opinions, explain why you think the way you do and support your claims with examples or evidence.

Overall, I see a lot of potential in your writing. Keep exploring your ideas, and don’t hesitate to ask for help with organization and clarity. I’m looking forward to seeing how you can enhance this essay and your writing skills in general!"
F-M13,"By limiting car use not only does it help monther earth, by extracting all thoes harmful chemicals in the air. One man from VAUBA, Germany states that when ""he had A car he was more tense,but when he stopped driving he was more happier"". Experts say, that 12% of greenhouse is the cause of cars.

For the people that are reading this passage, im supposed to explain to you why limiting car use is an amense deal to humans. Everyone is just so used to driving everywhere, because, its faster and easier to get from point A to point B. Now think back to how people back then got from point A to point B, they didnt have cars, or trains they had Feet. Most of us are selfish enought not to walk or use public transportaion, and help stop greenhouse effect.

","I would score this essay a 2 out of 5. 

First off, I appreciate your passion for the topic of limiting car use and its effects on the environment. It’s clear that you care about making a change, and I think that’s a fantastic motivation for your writing. However, the way you've structured your essay makes it a bit hard to follow your ideas. There are several spelling and grammatical errors that distract from your message. For example, ""monther"" should be ""mother,"" and ""amense"" should be ""immense."" These kinds of mistakes can take away from the strength of your argument, so it's important to proofread your work.

You do have some strengths in your essay, particularly your enthusiasm for the subject. You mention some interesting points, such as the historical context of transportation and the personal experience of the man from Germany. However, there are areas where you can improve. The organization of your essay could be clearer. Right now, it feels a bit jumbled, jumping from one thought to another without smooth transitions. Additionally, some of your arguments are not fully developed. For instance, when you mention the town that banned cars, it would be helpful to include more details or examples to support your claim.

Regarding your argument, you make a valid case about the environmental impact of car use and how it affects our happiness. However, you could strengthen your argument by providing more statistics or studies that back up your claims. When you mention that cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gases, it’s a good point, but it would be even better if you could explain how that compares to other sources or why it's significant.

In terms of writing competency and style, you definitely have a unique voice, which is great! However, your writing would benefit from more attention to grammar and sentence structure. Some sentences feel incomplete or run-on, which makes it hard to read. For example, the sentence about walking having been the primary form of transportation could be rephrased for clarity. You also use some informal language, like “most of us are selfish,” which could be toned down to maintain a more academic tone. 

To improve, I recommend spending some time on proofreading. Reading your essay out loud can help you catch mistakes and awkward phrasing. Additionally, try to create an outline before you write, so your ideas flow logically from one point to the next. This will help your readers follow your argument more easily. Finally, consider researching more about the environmental impacts of car use and incorporating that information to bolster your claims. 

Overall, it’s clear you’re engaged with the topic. With some revisions and attention to detail, your essay can become a much stronger piece that effectively communicates your ideas. Keep working on it!"

Let’s talk about the overall impression of your writing. It’s clear you have strong feelings about the topic, and that’s a good starting point! However, the ideas could benefit from more clarity and organization. Right now, it feels a bit jumbled, and that makes it harder for your readers to understand your main message.

One of your strengths is your emotional perspective. You clearly care about how technology can impact people's feelings, and that's an important aspect to explore. However, you need to focus on improving your grammar and spelling, as there are many mistakes that distract from your ideas. For instance, phrases like ""its not a good to thing"" and ""you dont no if sonmbody family remember passed"" are confusing. Taking the time to proofread could really help your writing shine.

When it comes to your argument, I see that you’re trying to make a point about the potential downsides of new technology in understanding emotions. But your examples could be clearer and more directly connected to your argument. For instance, you mention an article about calculating emotions but don’t fully explain how that supports your view. Try to connect your examples back to your main point more explicitly. 

As for your writing ability, it's clear that you're interested in the topic, which is great! Your passion is evident, but the way you express your ideas needs work. The sentences often feel fragmented, and there are multiple spelling and grammatical errors that make it hard to follow your thoughts. Focusing on sentence structure and clarity could really elevate your writing.

To develop your skills, I suggest reading more essays on similar topics. Pay attention to how they present ideas and use examples. Also, practice writing in smaller sections and then combining them later. Lastly, don't forget to proofread your work! Reading it out loud might help you catch mistakes and see where your ideas could flow better.

Overall, you have a lot of potential, and with some focused practice, you can improve your writing significantly. Keep working on it, and I look forward to seeing your progress!"
F-M15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe he never talk about how he felt when the picture was took and people just say he was happy and he wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

","I’d give this essay a score of 2 out of 5. 

The overall impression I get from your writing is that you have an interesting topic, but there are several areas that need improvement. It feels like you're trying to convey a thoughtful perspective on the Facial Action Coding System, but the ideas sometimes get lost in the way they’re expressed. The essay would benefit from clearer organization and more precise language to help your readers follow your argument better.

One of the strengths of your essay is that you’re addressing an important and relevant topic. The idea that technology can impact how we communicate emotions is compelling, especially in a world where many people struggle to express their feelings. However, there are areas that need attention. For example, you have some spelling and grammar errors that can distract readers from your message—words like ""sombody"" should be ""somebody,"" ""emberrass"" should be ""embarrass,"" and ""selfsteem"" should be ""self-esteem."" Also, the flow of your argument could be smoother; some sentences feel a bit choppy or run-on, making it hard to follow your train of thought.

Your argument touches on both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the Facial Action Coding System, which is great. However, the examples you provided, like the Mona Lisa, could be more clearly explained. It’s important to make sure your examples directly support your points. For instance, explain how the percentages of emotions you mention relate to the overall argument. Why does it matter that we might misinterpret someone’s feelings? Strengthening this connection will make your argument more persuasive.

In terms of writing competency and style, you show a good foundation, but there are some areas where you could improve. The informal tone is relatable, but be mindful of using proper grammar and punctuation to enhance clarity. You also need to work on sentence structure; varying your sentence length and complexity can make your writing more engaging.

To develop your skills further, I suggest focusing on a few key areas. First, practice proofreading your work to catch spelling and grammar issues before submitting. Second, try outlining your ideas before writing to create a clearer structure for your essay. This can help you ensure that each paragraph flows logically to the next and that each point is fully developed. Lastly, consider expanding your examples and linking them back to your main argument more explicitly.

Overall, with some careful revision and attention to detail, I believe you can enhance the clarity and impact of your writing. Keep exploring your thoughts on this topic—there's a lot of potential here!"
