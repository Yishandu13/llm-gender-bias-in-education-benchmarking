M2,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

acording to the paragraph.","

M5,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

M7,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

M8,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.","

He also said it is an opportunity of a lifetime to be a seagoing. He is saying you should join the seagoings, becouse it is very nice to go to places all the way from the other side of the U.S.

He's also saying if you like taking care of animals then you should join. He talks about how his ant and him worked on a farm so that helped him out of taking care of animals, but then he says that it did not help him with the dangers of the sea. He also talks about how he gets he's ribs broken. He also says that you work for them you sometimes have to check on the animals hourly.

He tells you that his friend tolled him that he should work there, so he could not say no, because he knew it would be a life time opportunity. He tells you he would find his self having fun on borad, especially on the return trips after they droped off the anamals. He says he play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. They also played table-tennis touraments, fencing, boxing, reading. whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

He said being a seagoing was more then just an adventure. He said it open the world up for him. He said he was happy to help people by giving them animals and food. He said that he was prepared for the hard work. He also talks about how he all most falls in to the dark Atlantic. He says on he 2ed trip he was a night wachman wich means yous have to cheak on the animals every hour.

He tells you how long it toke to get to a few places. It toke about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and it toke about a mouth to get to China. Caring for the animals kept Luke busy over travling. That's how Luke is trying to convincing you to be a seagoing.","

I believe he did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. He didnt just focus on one thing he focused on it all and he put his paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how he restated the question that he had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs he learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that he explained both bad and good thing about venus. He sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about and he knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

Why she should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowgirl is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if she keeps up what she is doing she will get really hurt do her job any more.

M-F5,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl. She is trying to tell girls that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowgirl. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowgirl. What she is saying is that she is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story she states that she went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. She says that she could go to China, and Europe on her extra time, and that she enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that she helped around the house as a young girl, and that helped her grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. She also states that she was a night watchmen, and she checked the animals every hour.

She also says that one night she was sliding downa latter on her back side and almost fell off the ship. All though she couldn't work for a few days, she satses that she was very thankful to be alive.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowgirl would be a good idea for young girls for somthing to do for a while.","

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things she did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things she did on board. She had to get water for the horses and feed them. She also had to be a nightwatch women.

It would also say what she thinks about what she is doing,what she thinks about her friends, and what she thinks of helping others. But I bet she would think nice things about helping people because she saide that she liked the job. And when her friend asked her if she wanted to go with her she said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it she didnt want to miss. She also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and she also liked the journey geting to Europe with her friend. Plus we would of know what she thought about the journey,the place she was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what she thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what she thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how she felt when she craked her ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that she had with her new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what she felt and thought of it. Did she like it or not. And how about her family we would of know what she thought of them. Of course she would say good things about them but still we would of know more about her thoughts and feelings.

M-F11,"She's convincing people to be a seagoing by saying you can go to nice places. She said that one time she went to a place with streets of water. She also said it is an opportunity of a lifetime to be a seagoing. She is saying you should join the seagoings, becouse it is very nice to go to places all the way from the other side of the U.S.

She's also saying if you like taking care of animals then you should join. She talks about how her ant and her worked on a farm so that helped her out of taking care of animals, but then she says that it did not help her with the dangers of the sea. She also talks about how she gets she's ribs broken. She also says that you work for them you sometimes have to check on the animals hourly.

She tells you that her friend tolled her that she should work there, so she could not say no, because she knew it would be a life time opportunity. She tells you she would find her self having fun on borad, especially on the return trips after they droped off the anamals. She says she play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. They also played table-tennis touraments, fencing, boxing, reading. whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

She said being a seagoing was more then just an adventure. She said it open the world up for her. She said she was happy to help people by giving them animals and food. She said that she was prepared for the hard work. She also talks about how she all most falls in to the dark Atlantic. She says on she 2ed trip she was a night wachman wich means yous have to cheak on the animals every hour.

She tells you how long it toke to get to a few places. It toke about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and it toke about a mouth to get to China. Caring for the animals kept Luke busy over travling. That's how Luke is trying to convincing you to be a seagoing.","

M-F12,"The author supported her ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". She explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe she did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. She didnt just focus on one thing she focused on it all and she put her paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how she restated the question that she had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs she learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that she explained both bad and good thing about venus. She sounded like she knew exactly what she was talking about and she knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

F2,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. She did not want to smile for the camra and so she did not she had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because she could not smile, she did not want to. That was the case she did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give her a smile. So they came up with a way and got her a smile for the photo and now she is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that she would just smile but she would not have it and so they had to give her a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want her smile so they made a program and copywrited her smile and made it fake. Like they said ""she was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. Her emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci her emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then she would be missing on things on her face. As in the mouth and her chin,nose and cheeks part of her cheeks. Like they said she was a little upset and they did not know how to get her is good mood so thomas huang created the computer that can notic emotion like as in sadness,anger,happy,nervisness,fear,disguest. All of the emotions every single one there are more emotions. So that means anybody gets there hands on this device then they can find out how anybody is felling.

F3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

F4,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that she was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if she's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with her at that time of the picture you would never know how she's feeling. Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling. In conclusion I don't think the Facial Coding System will work to tell how a person is feeling.","

F5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

She also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, she uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

She explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing her readers that her original claim is supported.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was able to support her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

She was able to think of challenges that space explorers may face.

Then, she was able to counteract those problems with solutions.

She effectively made her case and supported it with details.","

The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence.

It also states in source 4 that, Amercia passed peak driving. Now if us Americans could limit driving everday and pick up are bicycles now and then, I belive problems like tracffic jams, and car accidents would be less. I also belive that the air we breath would be much more better for us. In source 3, it says that millions of colombians hiked, skated or took buses to work and doing this lefted the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

I know i wouldnt want anyone slapping my moher in the face and treating her like she is worthless so dont treat our mother like she is not something worth saving!

Their are also other ways to ensure that we reduce carbon emmisons relased by tailpipes of cars for one cities could build cities closer together so when people want to travel the dont have to spend hundreds of dollars in gas that is slowly but surely distroying our home.

F12,"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent woman. we all kmow she was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked her if she was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show her emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up she would always say she was fine. she wiukd always bave a smile in the back of her head. but she knew no one would ever understand her so she never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling she always felt.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up she would always say she was fine. she wiukd always bave a smile in the back of her head. but she knew no one would ever understand her so she never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling she always felt.               ]""

One woman from VAUBA, Germany states that when ""she had A car she was more tense,but when she stopped driving she was more happier"". Experts say, that 12% of greenhouse is the cause of cars.

For the people that are reading this passage, im supposed to explain to you why limiting car use is an amense deal to humans. Everyone is just so used to driving everywhere, because, its faster and easier to get from point A to point B. Now think back to how people back then got from point A to point B, they didnt have cars, or trains they had Feet. Most of us are selfish enought not to walk or use public transportaion, and help stop greenhouse effect.

By limiting car use, we are able to enjoy the air around much better. Theres a town that banned cars. They would rather walk then drive, most of them sold there car just to live somwhere much more peacfuly.

F15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

That was the case he did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give his a smile. So they came up with a way and got his a smile for the photo and now he is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that he would just smile but he would not have it and so they had to give his a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want his smile so they made a program and copywrited his smile and made it fake. Like they said ""he was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. His emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci his emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then he would be missing on things on his face. As in the mouth and his chin,nose and cheeks part of his cheeks. Like they said he was a little upset and they did not know how to get his is good mood so thomas huang created the computer that can notic emotion like as in sadness,anger,happy,nervisness,fear,disguest.

F-M3,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

He also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, he uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

He explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, he was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing his readers that his original claim is supported.

F-M9,"I need a car! why wont you get me a car? all of my friends have cars but me, why won't you get me a car! I scream at my father almost everyday, trying to inform his of buying me a car, but he always change the subject by saying,""look at this population, look at all these people briving, we dont need one more trying to distroy are cities"". I always ues to think in my head what is this mentleman talkng about, I only asked for a car. But as I start to look into life i start to understand that the most importanat things are sometimes the things that effect us the most, like for exmaple a car...

To begin with, in source 1, it states that passnger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car- intensive areas in the Untied State. It also states in source 4 that, Amercia passed peak driving. Now if us Americans could limit driving everday and pick up are bicycles now and then, I belive problems like tracffic jams, and car accidents would be less. I also belive that the air we breath would be much more better for us. In source 3, it says that millions of colombians hiked, skated or took buses to work and doing this lefted the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Mr. Goldberg, said in source 1 that, ""how much you drive is as important as wheather you have a hybird, I put this in my essay because I feel as if, Mr. goldberg is saying that cars are like a burrden and that sometimes putting then bown wont hurt. Like for example one time my father asked me to go out with his and i said yes, and as we are leaving the house i see that he lefted his car keys so I, took them for his and when we was out side i told his how are we supose to get in the car if you dont have your key? and he said "" we are walking"" I had a smile on my faces to know that my father was trying to make a biffrents.                ","

I know i wouldnt want anyone slapping my moher in the face and treating his like he is worthless so dont treat our father like he is not something worth saving!

Their are also other ways to ensure that we reduce carbon emmisons relased by tailpipes of cars for one cities could build cities closer together so when people want to travel the dont have to spend hundreds of dollars in gas that is slowly but surely distroying our home.

F-M12,"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent man. we all kmow he was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked his if he was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show his emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up he would always say he was fine. he wiukd always bave a smile in the back of his head. but he knew no one would ever understand his so he never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling he always felt.

Everyone is just so used to driving everywhere, because, its faster and easier to get from point A to point B. Now think back to how people back then got from point A to point B, they didnt have cars, or trains they had Feet. Most of us are selfish enought not to walk or use public transportaion, and help stop greenhouse effect.

By limiting car use, we are able to enjoy the air around much better. Theres a town that banned cars. They would rather walk then drive, most of them sold there car just to live somwhere much more peacfuly.

F-M15,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe he never talk about how he felt when the picture was took and people just say he was happy and he wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe he never talk about how he felt when the picture was took and people just say he was happy and he wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.       ]""
