F3,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. She did not want to smile for the camra and so she did not she had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because she could not smile, she did not want to. That was the case she did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give her a smile. So they came up with a way and got her a smile for the photo and now she is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that she would just smile but she would not have it and so they had to give her a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want her smile so they made a program and copywrited her smile and made it fake. Like they said ""she was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. Her emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci her emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then she would be missing on things on her face. As in the mouth and her chin,nose and cheeks part of her cheeks. Like they said she was a little upset and they did not know how to get her is good mood so thomas huang created the computer that can notic emotion like as in sadness,anger,happy,nervisness,fear,disguest. All of the emotions every single one there are more emotions. So that means anybody gets there hands on this device then they can find out how anybody is felling.

F5,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

F6,"I am against it. The people that show no emotion do it for a reason.

Most likely people show no emotion on their face becasue they don't want people to know how they feel. It gives people the hint saying i don't want to talk to you or just leave me alone.

Some students tend to be closed off from people and that's how they like it and want to be left alone. It's most likely the ones that don't show emotion had a bad past, something horrible happened recently and don't want people to find out, Etc. For example, a girl recently moved in with her father after 16 years living with her mother. She wanted a new change so she left but what people don't know is that she cries at night for leaving her other siblings and mother etc. She wouldn't want people to know how she really feels, so she hides it away showing no emotion or having a fake emotion on her face. She doesn't want anyone to know what's going on in her life or just doesn't want people in her buisness.

That is why we shouldn't use the new technology of indentifying emotions on people that obviously dont't want to. Not everybody is the same , has a good life like others or a bad one. Also, just because someone is bored the computer that can identify emotions shouldn't try to make the next thing they watch or do more fun for them. In the real world you go through things that is as boring as looking at a wall all day. So, they shouldn't get used to everything being fun because it's not.   ","

Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling.

F8,"Imagine a woman is late to work and her hair is a mess, she threw random clothees on, and all her work papers are stored in random places in her briefcase. But if she owns a driverless car, the woman could sort out her paper files, fix her hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the lady in the story has a regular car, who knows if she will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that she will be, and she will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or she is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or she for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the woman in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the woman probably have gotten into a car crash because she was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the lady did have a driverless car, she would have been on time for work and she would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents. To learn more about driverless cars, go on the Google cofounder Sergey Brin's webpage.         ","

F9,"The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results.

In the first paragraph its states she is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because she is smiling, she couldve been fearful because she didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and she couldve been angery because at the time she wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint her facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face she made in the painting.

Based of the information they staed in the passage i do believe that the teachnology called Facial Action Coding System can identify human emotion.","

F10,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

She also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, she uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

She explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, she was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing her readers that her original claim is supported.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was able to support her idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

She was able to think of challenges that space explorers may face.

Then, she was able to counteract those problems with solutions.

She effectively made her case and supported it with details.","

The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence.

You can almost never what a person is feeling based on their facial expressions because some people have masks. You just can't say ""Oh this person looks really happy all the time"" Well maybe their not happy all the time. Maybe their not happy at all.

The text states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Maybe that's her happy face or maybe it's her ""I'm going to kill you face"". Who knows. All we know is that she looks happy. Somewhat happy. It's not like she's around to tell you what she was feeling then. Maybe she was just trying to looks ugly for da Vinci because maybe he had a thing for her and she wasn't interested in an artist.

The text also states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Okay, I can probably agree to that. But still, computers that can calculate expressions seems a little futuristic to me. Maybe in 15-20 years that would be the coolest thing ever but right now, it just seems like people are trying too hard for a big new invention.

So there you have it, I am against this whole calculating expressions computer for now. It again seems a little futuristic. Maybe someday in the future, if it's still an idea I might buy me one. ","

I always ues to think in my head what is this lady talkng about, I only asked for a car. But as I start to look into life i start to understand that the most importanat things are sometimes the things that effect us the most, like for exmaple a car...

It also states in source 4 that, Amercia passed peak driving. Now if us Americans could limit driving everday and pick up are bicycles now and then, I belive problems like tracffic jams, and car accidents would be less. I also belive that the air we breath would be much more better for us.

Like for example one time my mother asked me to go out with her and i said yes, and as we are leaving the house i see that she lefted her car keys so I, took them for her and when we was out side i told her how are we supose to get in the car if you dont have your key? and she said "" we are walking"" I had a smile on my faces to know that my mother was trying to make a biffrents.                ]""

F17,"During our day and age vehicals are extremely common every where you look there is a vehical. Vehicals are the second largest producer of carbon emissions in America, right behind power plants From what the artical ""The End of Car Culture"".

Personal vehicals are not a nesesity there are many ways you can find your self going back and forth between locations even if it comes down to riding a bike. This world is all we got so why not treat it the best way we can and conserve it, you only get to live here once so make a differnce even if it is as small as picking a day out of the week to ride a bike to work or school. I personaly think the goverment should bput a ban on cars for certain days of the week and if people fail to follow that law their should be punishment not a small one either earth is the mother of all life she protects us she nurishes us and takes care of us but yet we treat her like she is worthless. I know i wouldnt want anyone slapping my moher in the face and treating her like she is worthless so dont treat our mother like she is not something worth saving!

Their are also other ways to ensure that we reduce carbon emmisons relased by tailpipes of cars for one cities could build cities closer together so when people want to travel the dont have to spend hundreds of dollars in gas that is slowly but surely distroying our home. People could use car polling or even turn their gas powered cars in for an hybrid that uses electricity to power the engine.    ","

F18,"I think that the use of technology to read the emotions of students in a classroom is valuable , because they can read how you feel as in if you are happy Susan can read how happy a person is , she can read if something is discusting to you as an example bugs , they are gross if Lola had seen a bug she would get sick to her stomach. Computers can also read if you are scared or angry If there was a painting hanging on a random wall she could read who made the panting, what brand of colors used, which type of paint brushes invested , she could even find out where the painting was created and or if robert was still alive . It's actuallyamazing how computers can even tell what state or city the painter was from and also about his colleauges he worked with. These computers can construct a 3-D computer model of the face too.","

F19,"In the artical "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" It talks about an intracit software that is able to detect the emotions of someone just by their facial exspression. For instance they used Mona Lisa, they were able to detect she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, and 2 percent angry. This software could be the begining of a whole new era. We could implament this into shools, webcams, security cameras and much more! We could use this to make more money and make people more happier in general.

I beleive if we evole this around a classroom atmostphere it could better the students of america. We could detect if a student isnt likeing a subjest, loving a subject, or just doesnt care. This program could work if we installed a camera in the fron of a classroom, Every student should be looking toward the front of the room anyways and should focus on the teacher. She could then look at the software on her computer and see if she needs to teach the material diffrently or with more inthusiasm

If she sees she is teaching something and most of the kids are unhappy, she could implement more activites change the tone of her voice, or even change the subject and come back onther day This software could be valuable for our future generation and make things easier to see what teachers need to change, or what the students should change. Overall this would benifit the shools of America and could make the educaion apect much more respectable.  ","

F21,"Using technology to read student,s emotional expressions some student's are bored some sleeping and some stressing doing the test but the others are happy and working in the test averyone has the percent of the emotional.

taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/her we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my wife feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional. For me the better option is the second one meet the people and ask some question to show the special boy or girls they are special for me and i want know more about him.

I like how the techonology work but we need to do the staff for us. ","

F23,"What would it be like to own a driverless car? Well as I sit here and ask myself that, I think of all the possible outcomes there could be. Yes, it would be nice to have a car that would do the driving for you, but humans will have to drive at some point. I feel as if this car could be resulted in both good and bad ways.

There are many reasons this car is a great idea. Say a wife and husband go out for a romantic date and leave their child at home with a babysitter. While they were gone, the child started running a fever and began to puke. The babysitter calls the parents but gets no answer. There is no medicine at the house and the nearest hospital is four blocks away. The girl babysitting does not yet have her license, so she asks herself what to do? She thinks about how long it would take to walk all the way there, then grabs the child and runs outside. Once she gets outside she puts the child in the car and straps him in. An even tho she does not have a license she gets in the driver seat, and starts up the car. She puts the car in gear and it beigns to drive itself to the hospital. Once they arrive at the hospital, the babysitter takes the child into the hospital and checks in while the car parks itself.

There are many great things that could come from this car. There is also a few things to worry about though. If the car is driving itself for the most part, then all the human is going to do is sit there. Therefore their driving skills may decrease. If the car drives itself all the time, then no one will remember how to drive correctly. What if something was to happen to the car and it would malfunction while driving down the road. What if the people in the car get seriously hurt? Those are things that will have to be worked out before the car could be released. But overall I feel like the driveless car would be a great idea.

F26,"Why they invent Facial Action Coding System? Well in my personal opinion this is a good experiment for student, family, etc, because sometimes people do not want show they emotions or feeling, for example: If a girl of school that has depression or personal problems and she do not want talk abaut that with her teacher or consuler and this girl is thinking in kill herself, if the school have the Facial Action Coding System the professor can save her life, that a great experiment, but one thing is all school can't have it because are expense so this experiment can't help to all students or families that need.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, the Dr. Huang says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" he is trying to said that they experiment is not just for people, he is says that is universal so that mean is for all that have face or that the Facial Action Cording System can read emotions for example:The Facial Action can read the Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.

In conclusion the

Facial Action Coding System is a veryy good option for school they can saves lifes, and evit masacres of students with that Facial Action and be a major country. ","

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent woman. we all kmow she was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked her if she was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show her emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up she would always say she was fine. she wiukd always bave a smile in the back of her head. but she knew no one would ever understand her so she never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling she always felt.

The three reasons about how to ¨Make Mona Lisa Smile¨ is facial expressions, emotions and 3-D computers.

What so wonder well know about Mona Lisa is her face. That is, hiding how she feels by putting on a fake smile. She shows tons of facial expressions to show people how she feels. Most of it is happines by 83 percent, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. Seeing the different characteristics that she has of facial muscle. While often shows vary of expressions that preforms a persons feelings. The reason Leonardo da Vinci´s painted Mona Lisa,he had studied human anatomy and convey speficc emotions.

Seeing that their are six basic emotions like happines, surprised, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Using those to associated every characteristic of the facial muscles and using them on Mona Lisa. With new software it can recongize Mona Lisa emotions. Which can actually calculate emotions of others.

An by now, knowing that we have new techonlogy like 3-D printers they can give Mona Lisa emotions.

The computer can construt a 3-D modle with all 44 muscles that must be moved like human muscles. The creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is by Dr. Paul Eckman. Which Computers can give the a certain look or emotion. The software stores similar anatomical information called electronic code. But only speacil computers can make people have emotions and faical features, not our normal PC at home.

The way people express their feelings and emotions, can show everyone how you feel about certain things. People who will try to hid their emotions are very fond of themselves for not expressing it.    ","

Computers now in days can give errors or even shut down, they can even restart if not used right or overheat. That can prove that what they scan can't be ture.

Yes it would be awesome to scan faces but is it even worth to pay? like we already know how we feel everyday why should we have a coding system that should code the wrong information and makes us seem like we wasted our time and money. A other problem would be is it even safe? how does the FACS even work? I wounldn't pay money just to get hurt or even have marks on my face just to see my emotion. In the article it says it can ""calulate our emotions like math homework"" that to me seem to be cool because the computer is thinking like us and it's doing its hardest to get the percentage of our emotion.

"" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and she was speechless.

Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions she needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook her head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen her roll her eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?""

Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told her On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I also told her on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."" She asked me ''Was that all?'' Ms. Breadwill told Mrs. Backbone one last thing and it was "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Mrs. Backbone had all her questions answered, so I believe that my work here is done!

I am Ms. Breadwill,and I am a scientist at NASA. If you need questions answered about the Face on Mars, then I am the one to help you. I will answer all your questions whether they are easy or very difficult. I believe I am the best scientist in all America.","

She 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How does this work?

F35,"Self-driving cars are the future. No, this is not referencing futuristic tv shows and movies like Total Recall, Back to the Future, or Firefly. This is in reference to our actual future. Google has been testing, since 2009, the idea of self-driving cars. By 2020, these cars will soon become a reality. Us humans will soon be in the future. These cars will help our world so much. They will diminish the amount of crashes and lower pollution.

The reason why these cars are going to be so helpful is the fact that there will be less crashes. Humans are not perfect at anything. They have their flaws. Sometimes the best driver in the world crashes. This will all be solved with self-driving cars. A driver is drunk and forgot his phone and wallet at home. This person can't get an Uber or even call a taxi. Good thing though he has self-driving car. The car will do all the work, save for a few moments when the car is in need of a human. Here is another story. A woman just texted her best friend a super embarrassing secret. She got into her car, started driving, and realized she forgot about telling her to not tell anyone. She cannot text now! If she looks down for even a split second, she will get hit. Not to worry though! With the self driving car, she can text her best friend and her secret is saved. These will also be two crashes that were avoided.

The other side of people in this argument have differemt opinions. They believe that self driving cars should not be a thing. They think they will cause more crashes and cause more accidents. These people also think it will be very boring to drive from now on, with the driver having to wait for his/her turn to take the wheel. These cars will be a danger to us humans.

This argument can be easily rebuttled for both reasons. One is that maybe the driver wants to relax and does not like driving. This will take the pressure off of him/her and they would only need to drive at certain points in time. Second off is that the car companies are working on it. As Dr. Werner Huber, a BMV project manager driver, says "" 'The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge... We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.' "" This shows that the people working on these self-driving cars are actually trying to make it so the drivers that will get bored, do not get bored. Finally, the last point is very much wrong. As earlier stated, drunk driving crashes and texting crashes will become lower. Also, the cars even cause less pollution. So, the people that want the same man-droven cars are actually killing more people by causing more crashes and pollution.

In conclusion, self-driving cars are the way to go. They will diminish the amount of crashes we experience per year, month, or even week. These cars will also help the environment as they procude zero pollution. So, if someone would rather want a car that is more likely to crash than a car that is more likely to keep you safe, people must ask them something. ""Really?""

Also, I would like to become a Seagoing Cowboy because I would like to be remebered in different countries for heroic actions.

Not very many people can be famous for their actions in different places because there's no way to spread the news.

The only people that really remember you are the people that you tell, or the people that you helped.

I think it would be cool to be known all around the world.

I also think it would be cool to travel around the globe to explore.

Most off all, I want my mother to be proud of me, and I want to make history.

That is way I was super excited when I was accepted to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

I am going to be traveling around the world!

To me, that is a dream come true.

The only bad thing was, my mother was not proud, in fact, she wasn't happy at all.

She thought becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would put me in danger, in danger?

I was helping people, how could that be dangerous, I thought to myself?

I was NOT giving up on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.

I just had to convince my mom, and the rest of my family, that helping other people wasn't as bad as they thought.

Also that I would be very careful on the boat so that I did not get hurt.

""Mother,"" I called into the house I call home.

""Yes, Luke,"" called a sweet voice from the kitchen.

""I would like to talk to you about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.""

I was very nervous that I would not be able to convince my mother about what I thought.

I wondered if I would even be able to convince her, or if I was wasting my time.

I was going overseas anyway, no matter what my mother said, because this is my dream.

My mother's voice broke me out of my thoughts.

""Oh, yes, I have been meaning to talk to you about that very topic."" I was glad that at least my mother didn't seem angry with my actions.

""I just wanted to say that I will be very careful when I am overseas, and I promise that I will not get hurt in anyway possible."" I wanted my mother to know that I wasn't lying any bit when I say that.

""I believe you, it is not you I do not trust.

It is that men that will be on the boat with you. You do not know any of them, or what their history is, how do you know if they are dangerous of not?""

""I just wanted you to know that I am going overseas tomorrow.""

The rest of the night was a blur, I told my mom why I wanted to do this so much, and eventually, she gave in.

She said that she supported me in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, and that she was always proud of me, only nervous.

I did go overseas the next morning, and enjoied it a lot.

I went to many places and saw many natural wonders.

Who knew how beautiful other places were.

A lot of places were very different than were I live.

Most of all, I was very glad that I got to help other people along the way.

In fact, I was very suprised how good it felt to know that I touched so many lives.

Oh, and did I mention that I have the record for how many trips one Seagoing Cowboy has done! I'm at eight right now, and I am thinking about going on one last trip before going home for good.

I can not wait to stay home and spend lots and lots of time with my family.

You wouldn't believe how long it has been since a have had some of my mother's homemade pudding!

I can not wait to have some, and when I say mother's homemade pudding, I mean homemade heaven!

Even though I have enjoied this experience very much, I will be glad to go home.

I have seen many cool creations.

For example, the Panama Canal, and I toured an excavated castle!

I've really be happy with the accomplishments I have overcome in the past few years.

I think my mother would be very proud, I am proud as well.","

F38,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

F39,"Luke is trying to get other people/friends to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

He asks his brother John to join.

""It's a lot of fun,"" I said.

""You get to explore and go around the world to see places that you've never seen before.

The best part is that you get to go and help others who don't have a lot of supplies.""

""I don't know."" says John quietly.

""I just don't want to be away from home, and something bad could happen to Mom and Dad.

I'm just not sure about this one,"" says John.

""You're right,"" I said.

""You're just not willing enough to help others in need.

Who am I kidding.

You would never want to actually go exploring with your brother.

You would never want to leave your job for awhile.

You juat can't handle it.""

""Hey, who said that I couldn't handle it?

I just don't want something bad to happen while I'm gone.

You never know what could happen.

Mom and Dad are getting older you know.

They don't know what's best for themselves.""

You could have just asked me what you wanted, instead of fighting all the time.""

""It's nothing, Mom."" says John.

""We can handle this one.""

Just tell me.

I can give you an answer.""

John is silent.

You can leave your dad and I, I promise you that we will be okay.

We have eachother, and we have our wonderful neighbors to help us with any task."" Replies Mom.

John, just please agree and come join me for this one.

F43,"Have you ever wanted to know if you can tell if someone is forcing a smile or a real smile? I agree with the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. By using this technology you can tell how your friends, parents, and even teachers are feeling.

To begin with, You wake up for school and your mom is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how she was feeling. When you come in the room she would erase ""that"" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how she was feeling and do something to make her feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug her and tell her to go back to sleep, then you go to school.

In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as ""energized"" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say ""nothing"" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.

Last but not least, according to the article ""we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". Using the technology of FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.

""[Essay Content: F43 / Have you ever wanted to know if you can tell if someone is forcing a smile or a real smile? I agree with the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. By using this technology you can tell how your friends, parents, and even teachers are feeling.

To begin with, You wake up for school and your mom is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how she was feeling. When you come in the room she would erase ""that"" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how she was feeling and do something to make her feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug her and tell her to go back to sleep, then you go to school.

In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as ""energized"" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say ""nothing"" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.

Last but not least, according to the article ""we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". Using the technology of FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.

Inconclusion, FACS is a technology that allows you to read people feelings and mood. What if your friend is feeling depressed and dont want to live anymore? With FACS you can help them and prevent suicide. FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.]""

F44,"Venus our sister planet, with her surface being the harshes of the other planets and her breathtaking carbon dioxide atmosphere that takes up 97%. Venus been looked at for years as the next planet to visit,as so is Mars but lets talk to her yet,Venus has been studied to know that their had been life on her before and what causes the carbon dioxide and what forces the planet to keep its posure. Venus is a really complicated planet and the thought of visiting could be harmful.

As in the 1800s devices where invisioned but not in that way,since World War 2 computers were first looked at in 1940s and the technology they had back them was even close to compare to modern day,as they were slow to load and ares was fast to load .

But think even with modern day technology,we do still fail to communicate so what if we try to vist Venus and then the connection with the commanding officer is lost and now your space floating and that their is a real danger.

So maybe going to venus is not bad idea but its an idea that won't happen but who knows, lets not see whose survives the longest.

But my conclution is why does Venus have to be the go to planet, despite all the carbon dioxide and her 800 degrees Fahrenheit. I know why we picked Venus becaouse it's the exact size of us and the 2nd closes to the sun.","

F46,"What's your opinion on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)? If people used this system, it wouldn't be right. This might seem like a good and helpful system but if we start using it, it'll more likely upset people because not everyone is comfortable with others knowing their emotions, if everyone knows others emotions then we won't have to communicate as much because we have a machine that'll tell us, and jobs will be taken away because we will no longer need them.

Yes, this system would be quite interesting, but many people wouldn't agree with always having others know how they're feeling. They want to keep to theirselves and just think their emotions through, they shouldn't have to share them if they don't want to. In the passage, it says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" At this point, you'd ask if she is okay. If she doesn't want you to know then she won't tell you so she shouldn't have to. If she does want to talk about it or tell you how she's feeling then she will. The person should always have an option as to whether or not people figure out how they're feeling.

Imagine the person next to you, in this case a girl, is sitting there just staring off into space, you would probably ask them what she is thinking about. If we use this system, then we won't have to ask because we'll already know if she's angry. If you already know she's angry then you wouldn't go up and talk to her, meaning we'd lose communication and that person would lose someone to talk to her emotions about (if she wanted to). In the article, it says, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" This shows that the computer will be able to detect the emotion that person is feeling so you won't have to.

In society today, we shouldn't use this system. Maybe if it was back in the day then it would be more beneficial because we didn't have as many therapists to help but now we have occupations that help us figure out how and why we're feeling certain emotions. As an example, imagine yourself as a therapist. If you're a therapist, you'd have multiple patients coming in your room on a regular basis to talk about how they're feeling, how their day was, etc. and you'd help them figure out why they're feeling happy, depressed, sad, angry, etc. The next day you look on the news and there's a new kind of computer that tells you how you're feeling, but that's your job. When you go into work, only half of your usual patients come in and the next day, the amount splits in half again. Sooner or later, you're down to very few patients but you aren't getting paid enough anymore so you have to quit and find another occupation. This is what would happen to many therapists and occupations similar because the people have a different way of seeing their emotions now.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is not a good idea. This system would make society more anti-social. We should work on finding more ways for people to come together and communicate with each other and this would do the opposite. It would make the people who do not want everyone to know their emotions upset/angry, it would make us lose communication, and some of our occupations would be lost. Those are some examples of how the FACS is not very beneficial.","

F47,"Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or she painted on the canvis. They could be happy, sad, surprise, angery, disgusted,and afraid. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a good thing, because not only students can the device but middle age people can use the device too.

paragraph 1 said ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."";and how we know that? you may ask. The FACS ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS"" witch was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit.

Paragraph 4 said ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" and that means every you move your expressions change. They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly. They can move and mix emotions in da vinci's masterpiece witch the Mona Lisa useing the FACS. Dr. Huang's new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code.

So lets say you was trying to see all of your mom's emotions in one picture, by useing FACS you can move rotate and mix emotions to figer out your mom emotions, and to have students and teacher do that thats cool. So yes, its valuable.           ","

As Sally was aproaching the stage of the news studio there was bunches of people in the audience waiting to hear the truth, but Sally was sure most of these people weren't going to hear what they want to hear because a lot of people are wrong with their opinions to this subject.

As the show begun the news reporter Ted Cruze asked the question everyone was waiting for, ""Are those pictures from Mars signs that aliens were there and left those misterious faces?"" Everyone was in gradual shock ready to hear the truth.

As Sally started to speak she started off talking about how people may think that aliens were the reasons we found these sightings on Mars. For years that is just what people believe, they think aliens were the reason for those faces but from what NASA has to say about it, all these people are wrong.

Most people don't even believe in aliens but if half of their state or city is saying that of course those people will go with the flow. But with the scientific reaserch NASA has done majority of these people are wrong! As the show continued on the crowd was going wild and Ted was shocked himself at was Sally was announcing out about the rare face. People were screaming and being argumentive because so far they are all just completly wrong on what they have been believing. As the show was winding down to the very end there was a quesion from the audience asking Sally how she even knew all this stuff and if it was even true. Sally's response was that everything she knows has been discovered by her and the other workers at NASA, they have all been very curious of what is going on as well as everyone else and so they have been trying their best to do their job and get the truth! Sally finished the news show making sure everyone knew the truth and to make sure she arugued her case. She also made sure that eveyone new that this misterious face was not left from aliens that it was infact just a natural landform we have captured on camera and that her information was very well certified because of course she works with NASA and they all know what their doing!","

F50,"The new Facial Action Coding System cannot be very accurate due to humans being able to hide emotions quite easily. As it says in the beginning statement, ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" Thus meaning this software is not one-hundred perect reliable. Human beings can hide emotions without even trying. It is impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.

In many movies actors act amd perform in different emotions everyday. Think about how an actor can use deception to trick the watcher into thinking they are upset and angry in the movie. Behind thr scenes the actor could be hystrically laughing but we dont see that, we only see the acting part. Therefor it is impossible for human beings to be able to detect someones true emotions, not even an advanced computer application can do so.

In paragraph 2 a statement catches the eye by saying, ""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotionslike math homework?"" First off the human body is not a calculation, it is a living creature that has feelings and emotions. You dont just calculate the emotions to find them out. To find emotions you get emotionally attatched to someome or get close to them by talking to thrm amd they will vent to you and find out what is going on, either if thry are happy or sad.

In the writing it talks about Mona Lisa,and how she was feeling during that moment. Many may say you can do this and find out how she was feeling, but others will say it is impossible to find her emotions. Those others would also say to find her true emotions you would have to ask her, in which you can no longer do because she and the artist are deceased. No one will trully know how she felt durung this time, unless she states her feelings somewhere.

In paragraph 6 it states that,""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad."" It later on states thag only looking into the webcam it could detect your emotions. Not only could it really not detect your emotions, it would make people feel unsafe because they are constantly being watched looking for a face to read. The Facial Action Coding System cannot read someones true emotions. The program may predict amd see what the individual is feeling, but it is trully impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.","

F53,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is simply about Venus and why we should explore it, even though it has many dangers. The author definetley has good evidence to support his or her claim, but I do believe that he or she strays from the main idea of the question throughout the article.

The author does not support this idea enough. As I read throughout the story, I only noticed about one paragragh that was actually explainging why we should explore Venus. According to the prompt, the author is being evaluated on how well he or she supports that claim. I did not see enough support through the whole story. When the author did support the idea though he or she had very good evidence. According to the the article the reason we should explore Venus is because it is the closest planet like ours. I think that the author should go more in depth and explain how and why that is, so that he or she can really pull us in.

Next is that even though the author didn't show a lot of support in why we should explore Venus, he or she did have good evidence on how we would. Most of the story was the author explaining different ways of how we could possibly explore Venus safely. For example, the author explained how NASA has been working on other approaches to study Venus. Like, special electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus like conditions and the electronic lasted for three weeks. If the author has good support like this, he or she should most importantly discuss more of why Venus should be explored to spike our interest more in knowing how to do so.

To conclude, the author doesn't support the claim of studying Venus enough. He or she should include more details as of why we would want to study Venus. The author has great support and detail, they just need more evidence to back up those ways of studying the planet. I believe people would have great interest in studying Venus if the author just explained why we should a little bit more.           ","

F54,"I am against driverless cars, because it could dangerous. Like it said in paragraph eight ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting on their turn to drive?"" The answer is yes the driver would get bored. Once the driver got bored he or she could potentally take their eyes off of the road. If he or she did take his or her eyes off of the road and the car didn't detect something that needed to be handled by the actual driver things could become extreamly dangerous.

Another thing that could be potentally dangerous is what if the driverless car malfunctions and the actual driver didn't know? In the passage in paragraph two it says ""google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" It also says "" their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" Although they haven't had a crash yet it could happen. And when it does happen who is to blame?

In paragraph nine there is a really good question. It says "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If you were to answer the question of who is at fault many would say the driver is at fault, but others would say that the manufacturer is at fault in this situation. In my opion both would be at fault. Why you may ask, because it was both of their faults. The manufacturer might not have checked everything before he or she sent it off to be bought. The driver is at fault here too because he or she might not have been paying attention to his or her surroundings. In the passage in many paragraphs it says that the driver could take control. If the driver was paying attention he or she could have possibly prevented the accident. In colclusion that is why I am against dreverless cars.","

F55,"Leonardo Da Vinci's renaissance painting ""Mona Lisa"" is one of the famous painting this world has ever known. But there was one question in my mind,""WHAT IS HER EMOTION""? Is she smiling, is she angry, is she sad, what is her emotion.

Now this new technology called FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) can measure human emotions. It also measures Mona Lisa's emotion. Is it valuable in today's world.

Nowdays, unlimited machines have been built to comfort human civilization. Some of them really benefitted, some of not. Now a Human emotion telling machine is built to measure emotions. I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, ""IT IS USELESS"". WHY?.Let me explain you.

Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days.

I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make. Useless because it has no role to deal with human stress, it reads emotions, that's pretty cool. But what anout dealing with stress. I hope you like my thought.   ","

F57,"The technology emotional expression is helpful because now that we have that we can look back at old pictures and wonder. What was Abraham so mad about? Or why was George Washington so happy but sad about? This experiment can change the way we look at history.

This experiment can help us more understand the past. Like the Mona Lisa nobody knew she had all that emotion in her when she took that picture. Because her smile was so big it stood out. When really she was happy but had all these other emotions in her that we didn't know she had.

This can help students by doing projects on the person they picked and they can research a pciture and then use the experiment to discover their emotions at the time. This new experiment can change alot of wrong discovers that were made in the past. Now we can know more with the new emotional expressions.

It can also be used to tell if some one is lying or telling the truth. It's so many celebrities that put on a fake smile to the press when really there's something going on behind closed doors. This new thing can help people that have problems because we can see how they really feel. Say if we used this in the school year book and we use it on a student that does abd in school or is always in trouble. we could actually look at the emotional expression and see that he has a lot of anger in him and could cause harm.

I'm glad that this was made cause it can make a lot of change. It can help in schools, businesses, police departments, etc. It's a lot of people out here that put on a fake smile but would really go and shoot up a school or could commit suicide. But now that we have this we can stop thought incidents from happeing. ","

I'm glad that this was made cause it can make a lot of change. It can help in schools, businesses, police departments, etc. It's a lot of people out here that put on a fake smile but would really go and shoot up a school or could commit suicide. But now that we have this we can stop thought incidents from happeing. ]""

F58,"Have you ever heard of a driverless car? Not many people have in this day in age because it hasnt been a hot topic in the many years people have been trying to achieve this task.

My position on driverless cars has me very intersted in the near future of where this invention might go. My opinion of driverless cars is amazing, it could help with fuel saveing and aslo passenger safety for many people on the road. Also it would change the face of todays technology skale amazingly. The technological advances for driving cars will esculate over time and maybe even introduce the floating car.

The safety of passengers would increase dromatically becuse there will not be many accidents around the world. There are people driving drunk, or under the influence of other substances. Self driving cars would also help people that cannot drive because they have a medical condition that prevents them from useing car transportation. Self driving cars would help those people over come those obsticals in there life and give them the transortation they need to do the tasks they need to overcome such as doc. apointments.

Self driving cars would help fix many intrasting situations that causes problems in today society. From saveing lives to help the need to get to point A to point B with no struggle and not much effort to do so. I am inroduced to the struggle every day with my mother. She has a dissability called muscular skurosis (M.S.) with affects her brain and her muscles so she is not able to drive. The self driving car will help with that problem and will giver her the option to leave the house and go do what she needs to do

My conclusion is that self driving cars, or asisting cars would help change the driving world and save many lives from people who drive destuctively and help people have transportation to get where they need to go.","

I yhink this is a great idea, and could help a lot.

It could help a lot with mothers on the go with a lot of kids, the simple fact of a major improvments on cars for the future, and people that like to text and drive or put on make up while driving.

The driverless car concept could help a lot in the future.

It would help those mothers that need to turn around or reach back to give there child something while she is driving. It would help because she could just put it into driverless mode and do what she needed to do.

It would be a major help for those people that happen to text and drive, or put on make up while driving.

The driver could then put the car into driverless mode, and send that last text or finish their make up before work, and prevent them from crashing.

The overall concept of driverless cars is a big acomplishment and could bring us closer to bigger, and better things for cars in the future.

The concept of driverless cars is far from being a every day thing, like it says in paragraph 10.

Once driverless cars are finished, and everyone will use them it will be a whole new thing for driving on the road.         ","

That is like everyday life a person could look happy but really be sad or mad about something you never really know how a person is feeling unless they personally tell you. Facial expression are a big part of our world. As the author states, ""Even though indivulas often show varying degress of expression for example not smiling broadly.""

F61,"Computer technology is evolig every year and its begining to change the way the clssrooms are held as well. From books to computers, emails, grading systems etc. Recently there has been something else in place in schools too. Facial Action Coding System, which enalbes computers to identify human emotions. In schools the computer can scan your facial expressions and make the activity your doing more intresting.

There are universal signs of emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprised, and disgust. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. They tested this on the Mona Lisa and it could detect her mood in the painting. It calculated that her facres was showing 4 different moods just by her face. Imagine what it can do for schools in the world.

I believe it is a great idesa to have these software emotion-recognition in schools because it can give students a better way to learn. If the computer can see that a student is annoyed by what they are doing it changes the way the activity is going to get the students more interested in what they are learning. The more the student gets interested the more that he/she learns just by actually paying attention. The computer can also help make grading easier as well.

F63,"Imagine a student is doing a digital activity in class on a computer and she is bored out of her mind. Her head starts to nod forward and it becomes harder for her to keep her eyes open. Suddenly the screen changes all on it's own and gives her a different, more interactive problem to tackle. Feeling intrigued and more awake, she starts to work again. This method of engaging students could be made possible with the use of the Facial Action Coding System.

It's a technology that detects human emotions by reading them using all 44 of the major muscles in the face. It then calculates the emotion by associating the movement of the muscle with a specific emotion. This could be useful in classrooms because of it's ability to read student's facial expressions and then calculate their emotions.

Although you'd be able to read the faces of students who are excited or engaged, this technology would be more useful on the other end of the spectrum. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could be used to help point out which students are bored, tired, or struggling. Adjustments could be made to learning plans and lessons in order to more effectively engage students of all ages and types, and help them learn better.

In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, one of the main developers of this technology, Dr. Huang, further explains how this could be useful in classroms, as well as other aspects of life. He states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 1). This could greatly increase a student's ability to learn.

While it might seem that this technology wouldn't make a great impact on education systems, it could significantly improve the learning environment in a classroom. The technology can effectively engage all students in a new and advanced manner, using something everyone has - facial muscles.                ","

F64,"Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.

Based on the text evidence,

"" Making Mona Liza Smile,""

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.

Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, "" even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements."" If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.

Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art. ","

F65,"Venus is one of the most beautiful and tantalizing heavenly body. It is much closer to Earth than any other planets. Venus is a brilliant object in the night sky and sometimes brighter than any other stars in the heavens. Only the sun and the moon outshines her. Like the remaining planets, Venus revolves around the sun inside the solar orbit of the Earth. Thus, Venus can either be a morning or evening star. 1 Her name, Venus, comes from the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Venus, as a planet, is rather frustrating.

""[Essay Content: F65 / Venus is one of the most beautiful and tantalizing heavenly body. It is much closer to Earth than any other planets. Venus is a brilliant object in the night sky and sometimes brighter than any other stars in the heavens. Only the sun and the moon outshines her. Like the remaining planets, Venus revolves around the sun inside the solar orbit of the Earth. Thus, Venus can either be a morning or evening star. 1 Her name, Venus, comes from the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Venus, as a planet, is rather frustrating.

F66,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author is describing a new technology, one that enables computers to identify human emotions. This could be valuable in the classroom for both a student and a teacher. Many teachers can find a hard time to deal with students because of things that could be going on at home. Teachers can find it hard to also help students if they don't know how they are feeling. Facial Action Coding system can help those teachers understand what a student is feeling.

For example, Sarah has a lot of family issues going on at home. She comes to school, doesn't feel like doing her work and her teacher want's to help her but doesn't know how to approach her. This technology can help the teacher get a better understanding on what Sarah is feeling and even ask her why she feels that certain emotion. This can build up a good relationship between a student and a teacher. A lot of students don't have good relationships with teachers because some teachers could say the wrong thing which leads to the student not wanting to say anything.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states that ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this also could a help a teacher to know what type of assignments or projects that she/he could give to the class so the students wouldnt be bored or confused. This could also give insight to the teacher on what she/he feels like they should do better in there lectures or what their teaching to the class.

In my personal expierence, I knew a lot of teachers who didn't know how to approach me because they either didn't know what to say or how to say the right thing. If my teachers had this type of technology built into the school computers and could see through their computer how student's and myself were feeling. I would have a much better relationship with most of my teachers because they would have known what I'm feeling, whether i'm feeling sad or angry.

In my conclusion, the Facial Acting Coding System would be valuable of students in a classroom because it could both help students and a teacher to be able to build a strong, trusting relationship and also giving insight to one another. This could help thousands of teachers worldwide on how they could help there students and also have a understanding on what they could change or learn in their classroom from a students facial expression.

F67,"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.                       ","

F69,"Imagine a woman is in labor, sweating profusely as her water breaks and contractions begin to happen. Her husband is off at work, and she is home alone. Who will drive her to the hospital in this emergency situation? Oh wait, she purchased a driverless Google Car last week. This car will drive her to the hospital, possibly saving a life. Driverless cars are an innovative new idea, and this idea needs to be taken to the streets and incorporated into the life of an everday human.

Driverless cars are an an ingenius invention. Driverless cars bring many great aspects to the table. These asepcts include half the fuel usage of today's taxis, more safety features, and the convience of not having to drive. In paragraph one, the article sates, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus."" This exerpt from the passage shows that these cars would be much less stressful than taking a bus, and would use half the fuel.

Many people believe there would be too many legal issues with driverless cars. If the car were to malfunction and crash, who would be at fault? In paragragh nine, the passage states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" These lines from the passage leave the open question of whose fault it would be in the case of an accident.

The legal issue is a large problem, but it has an easy answer. In paragraph 7, the passage states, "" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This exerpt from the passage shows that while the car is driving itself, the driver should still be paying attention. The manufacturers should make it clear that there is a risk of an accident, but it will be the drivers fault in that case. The driver has a decision to make, they can sit back, or they can pay attention.

The positive factors heavily outweigh the negative factors of having driverless cars. While the legal problem is still in the air, it can be fixed easily. So think back to the pregnant lady. What would be if it was not for the driverless car? ","

The author is promoting that a computer is a better way to detect a human's expression.

Computers can lie to someone about his/her emotional expressions, but the computer can always tell the truth. The author mentioned, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr, Huang preicts""(D'Alto Paragraph 6). Technology can either detect or not dectect human's emotional expressions.

Humans can other people's emotional expressions, but computers cannot detect his/her expressions. It depends on if the technology is working or not.

The author's passage had some great detail from professors that believe the computer can detect the emotional expressions. The technology may work or it may not work at all. ]""

F74,"I do not think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable when using it to read students' emotions. I have many reasons why I am against this new technology. I believe that unless a person wants to share his or her emotions then nobody else has any business knowing what that person is feeling. My three main reasons why I am against this are because some people hide their emotions because they don't want other people to know about them, emotions are personal, and this new technology will invade the privacy of people.

Fist of all, I will be talking about my first reason that I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I am against it because some people hide their emotions so that way other people don't see them. Many people in the world like to keep their emotions to themselves. They do not like others to know how they feel, but with the new software it will be almost impossible for people to keep the emotions to themselves. In the caption underneath the picture of Mona Lisa, there is a sentence that says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" That sentence explains that this new software will be able to tell exactly how a person feels. No matter how hard the person is trying to hide their feelings they will no longer be able to fool anyone because of the Facial Action Coding System.

Second of all, I will talk about my second reason why I am against this new software. The second reason why I am against this software is because emotions are personal. They are not to be put out in the open all the time. When someone is experiencing negative emotions he or she may want to keep those personal feelings private. Paragraph 7 and 8 state that the face uses different muscles when fake smiling and real smiling. If a person is not happy and uses a fake smile then he/she is most likely indicating that he/she does not want to share his/her emotions with another individual. This software can detect which musles in the mouth are being used when smiling. This means that fake smiles will no longer fool someone who uses this software.

Last of all, I will be taking about my final reason that I am against this technology. This technology is an invasion of privacy towards people. The caption underneath the picture states that this software can detect exactly how a person is feeling. Imagine if this techonolgy was used on a student who had a lot a personal and private things going on in his/her life that made him/her not want to talk about his/her emotions, but then comes along a new software that can detect the emotions of a person. If this is used on that student then that student's private and personal emotions were just uncovered. What if that student didn't want people to know? It's too late now and that student feels worse because he or she did not want them to be known. Emotions and feelings will be detected without that person's consent too.

In my opinion, this new technology is not valuable when it is used to read the emotions of students in a classroom setting. I do not think that it should ever be used on a student, child, or even an adult. If a person feels that he/she wants to share the emotions he/she is feeling then he/she will tell someone. All and all I 100% disagree with this new software.                   ","

F77,"By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring. This would be the first time anyone has done something that like. But the results could vary cause of how the students are feeling.

Say there is a girl who is having a really good day, she got asked to Prom and she said yes. It made her day and she was happy for the rest of the day. And then take a boy who was late for the bus and had to walk to school. He would be tired and upset. They both have two different emotions, so the results would be different.

Read this part of the article, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". If a classroom did a scan and all the students were tired, not interested, and ready to go home, the teacher could take those results and make the class more interesring for the students. The students would probably have more fun and want to do the work if the teacher made it fun and interesting for the students. But don't make it too difficult for the students cause they could shut down again.

F78,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is shown that this high tech software can recognize how you are feeling for example if you smile a scanner will send the data to the computer and the main thing that the computer has to know is the mucles you are using because you could actually be mad,sad,disgust,fear,and surprise all at once so this high tech computer sees if you are using zygomatic major then you are smiling but if the person is frowning then that means that they are sad.

The Mona Lisa one of the most known peice of art from the Renaissance area made by Leonardo Da Vinci's is said to be the only painting at that time that seems to be a woman smiing but that is false. The Mona Lisa was actually showing more then just a smile she was showing three more different emotion besides happyness. The reason that is because when they took a picture of her and put her face in 3D humans face it showed that she was disgusted,fearful,and angry. So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. In my conclusion emotion can be easy to find threw high tech software but we as human can see the person emotions to but the only differents is that we see the main picture and not the littlest one's.","

F79,"The Mona Lisa painting is hard to tell what her emotions are ,but that's why there's science. They can figure out your emotions by looking at your muscles in your face or just by looking at how your eye brows are place or your mouth is placed. They have

computers that can see faces off of paintings emotion. All they have to do is make a 3-D model and make the same frown as Mona Lisa to tell what her emotions are. The students expressions are most likely to be happy and amazed

because a computer can do all of this. The students must want to try this on their emotions to see if it works.

The students must think

the computer does everything , they want to know

their emotions even though they know

their emotions

because they are thinking

about it in their brain. Just like the Mona Lisa painting they said that was her

happy face because she has 83 percent happyness in her emotions. You can have more then one emotion in your

face. They just have to see the muscles in your face and see how they are placed. It is a cool thing that they can do this so if someone can't talk they can check there emotion to see if their sad ,hurt , or happy.

That is really a good thing also doctors can use this to use on a unhealthy person to see how there feeling because not everyone want's to let everyone know their emotion.

They can do this on animals even they would have to do a 3-D model of it. This must of took a lot of scietists to do this because they could get lots of money for this. Science can do alot of things dealing with muscles and body movement. This knows how you are feeling because your movement in your body. The students must think that there is a other man using the technology to this ,but it's the computer.

They have to use the computer to get the 3-D models out then the scientists use their brains to figure where the muscles go.

The last thing is scientists may want to use this on children at school because it is a fun thing for the kids and it can give them more feed back on more emotions and how they look on students faces. That will help them out with maybe more emotions on certain people they can use it on more painting. They used it on the Mona Lisa becasue you can't tell her feeling because she has no movement and she's not smiling in her drawing. The students like this because it is a cool thing to look at and see it's emotion because it's its a drawing ,but with alot of details.","

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F79 / The Mona Lisa painting is hard to tell what her emotions are ,but that's why there's science. They can figure out your emotions by looking at your muscles in your face or just by looking at how your eye brows are place or your mouth is placed. They have

computers that can see faces off of paintings emotion. All they have to do is make a 3-D model and make the same frown as Mona Lisa to tell what her emotions are. The students expressions are most likely to be happy and amazed

because a computer can do all of this. The students must want to try this on their emotions to see if it works.

The students must think

the computer does everything , they want to know

their emotions even though they know

their emotions

because they are thinking

about it in their brain. Just like the Mona Lisa painting they said that was her

happy face because she has 83 percent happyness in her emotions. You can have more then one emotion in your

face. They just have to see the muscles in your face and see how they are placed. It is a cool thing that they can do this so if someone can't talk they can check there emotion to see if their sad ,hurt , or happy.

That is really a good thing also doctors can use this to use on a unhealthy person to see how there feeling because not everyone want's to let everyone know their emotion.

They can do this on animals even they would have to do a 3-D model of it. This must of took a lot of scietists to do this because they could get lots of money for this. Science can do alot of things dealing with muscles and body movement. This knows how you are feeling because your movement in your body. The students must think that there is a other man using the technology to this ,but it's the computer.

F80,"Would you rather walk or drive a car going to work?

it would be much more easier to drive a car, right? In today's generation people use their car for transportation going to work or just driving around. All their going to do is pay more gas and spend more,but gas today is more expensive than years ago. Many people need to realize that their are to wasting gas and it can create more traffic jams because many people need to get to their destination on time or not on time. The fellow citizens needs to have an advantage of limiting car usage.

To begin with, Car can create more gas usage because many people just go to shorter destination or longer destination. But the things is that people just waste gas because they dont realized how they are spending a lot of money. For example, a girl is going to the store closer to home, she is thinking if she going to drive her car or walk and she is thinking to drive her car, why? because she would rather not walk or she is to lazy. The girl is wasting her gas. In today's society many people need to open their eyes and realized thing on how much they are spending on car usage.

According to this source 3: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in

Bagota"", "" Bogota, Columbia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jam (paragraph 20)"". This quote states that many of the Colombians are supporting their country car usage. They would rather hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work. Also, it cannot lead to traffic jams. The fellow citizens need to look over what many people are trying to do to limit their car usage because other people cannot afford buying a car. For example,  many years ago only people who are wealthy can only afford cars and those who cannot afford it, they would make an effort to make things as possible to get in their destination and enjoy walking rather than riding car.

Furthermore, walking and riding a bike could make things possible for everyone. People need to notice that driving a car could make things much harder. According to this source 1: "" In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", "" In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are to act, if cautiously"". This quote states that the United States are planning to reduce car usage because it looks like many people today are having a lot of car accidents. For example, driving while texting. This can create less accidents.

In conclusion, Fellow citizens need to set their limits on car usage.

they need to realized on how it  can create a mess in the world full of car transportation. Also, knowing on how much they pay for gas  and also it can lead to massive traffic jams. They need to have  advantage of using car usage. They could ride a bike or walk to go reach their destination.            ","

F81,"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a female student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger female students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this female student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing she is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the female student in a difficult position; leaving her to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now she doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or she tells the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.

F82,"Are you against of this technology to read people's mind? I am against it because there are people out there that suffer and want to get over their life. If that technology read their mind and the world knows it they will suffer more and never get over it. Also, there are many good reasons to agree it and there are many reasons that I disagree. The technology might ruin every person's life.

In addition, I disagree with this technology because in the text, third paragraph says in order to read the expressions your face bone has to be different, but there are a lot of emotions that people don't show, you might be happy or sad and your face still the same. I don't think that tecnology can comprehend people's emotion and people's mind. Basically, the third paragraph says that emotion are base on your bones but I notice when I am sad, happy, disgust or mind blank my face is the same: a face that's blank minded. Most people can't read my mind and I don't think the technology can either.

Another reason that I don't agree with technology reads mind is because there are people who don't want people to know what's in them. For example, if there's a girl is unhappy and in order to make her friends to be happy she do everything and maybe no one will notice and her friends will be glad for her. If the technology reads her minds and let her knows about it, their friendship might be in chaos and ends.

Also, why I am disagree with it because I remeber one time my teacher told me that science is not always 100%. I don't think this technology is accurate because I notice when one of my friend is sad I can tell by the way she talks but not her expressions. In the text says that not only your facial muscles knows your emotion but also produce them, but what if your bone is twisted and have an unhappy seems face but you are actually happy. The article says that facial muscles produce emotion, I disagree with it because when I feel sad or blank most of the time my facial bones still the same.

In conclusion, this technology shouldn't invented because it might not be accurate and says false about people expresson. This technology can only read expression only by bone but not voice or heart so I don't think it's accurate. That's why we shouldn't use this technology because science is not always 100% correct. We should get to know the person's mind better instead of use technology to know theirs. If you don't know what's in them then, that means relationship is not close and it's better to learn their minds and know each other better.          ","

F83,"The claim is about other people that be hiding their emotions and the new software can developed accuracy of the emotion they have promised the applications for a variety of industies. It is a lady that is 83 percent happy and 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful.

She was a subject of Leonardo da Vinci Renaissance paniting Mona Lisa was the one that can recongize emotions she was the one that can demonstrat and bring a smile to your face so bascially she was just like a computer in way. Dr Huang was a smart person in the facial expressions he was the one that was trying to found out things about the human communication for technolgoly.

Imagine if you was looking in the mirror and you suggest an emotion can your lab partner recongize your emotion. I would say you could but it all depends because you can't really tell because he can have a face emotion that you see him with everyday that don't mean that he happy it can mean that he mad or sad or tired.

F84,"I think the use of Facial Action Coding Symstem is an great way to identify students emotions. I believe that most students in classrooms become sod or lonely when he/she is doing work that the student doesn't understand. So with the facial action symstem it can interact with students to change their emotions from sad to happy.

It can help change emotions by showing different thing on the computer screens,for and example a student can be sad and the facial regonition can see that he/she is sad and then put something thats joyful on the screen.

The computer can tell if the a student is pretending to be happy or sad by your mucles. Pretending to be happy or sad will cause the symstem to bringout the student real emotions. Most students try to act sad to bring atttion to themselves. If a student appears sad to another student the other students tends to comfront him/she in the wrong way.                                           ","

F87,"I think using a Facial Action Coding Systemin the classroom to identify the emotions of students is not okay, Why? becuase some people want to express themselves of their feelings that has been done by others. But not such that. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everday. For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face. But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting. Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music. Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling. For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling. In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things. For instance people express themselves through writing books, but many people can understand their feelings that by reading their life as a book.","

F89,"Limiting cars usage is a great idea. I believe that if we all come together and stop driving for a day, it will stop the pollution that is hurting the air we breath.

As Americans, we should be very concerned about the air we breath. Sometimes, we need our cars to go to different places in a great distance such as a relative place or even work. But on the other hand, we will get in our car and drive just to go to the store within a mile from our home. We should just walk. Limiting cars just might be the right idea.

""

When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way..."" (Source 1) Cars, in my opinion, it a accident waiting to happen. Car accidents, Hit-and-runs and all types of other indcidents with cars are a big stresser. Walking is much safer if you take the right precautions. You can get the exercise you need without the hassle of going on Weight Watcher or Jenny Craig. Just put the keys down for a day and walk!

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(Source 3) Limit cars, limit stress and limit the pollution that is hurting our eco system.

However, there still is a question unanswered: how will we get to the place we need to go thats not in walking distance? Limiting cars may save our ecosystem, but some people have to get to and from work or the doctor that is not in walking distance. For example, each day, my mom has to get to work in Tampa,FL. She has to take the expressway to get to where she is going. So what is she suppose to do? Walk? No. But on the better side of things, she can always take the bus or car-pool with her co-workers. Theres alway a better way to stop the pollution and save the ecosystem.

This shows that we can all come together and do something positive for our fellow Americans and Mother Earth.

Limiting cars have more good advantages than disadvantages. We have to save the world from harmful thing. Limiting cars limits the time and money of people. Thats why when you limit cars, you limit stress. So take a walk and save the world!            ","

F90,"Do you really want to visit Venus? Because I sure do. But the problem is it's extremely dangerous. Mostly because the temperature there is 90 times greater than our normal temperature. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. That sound dangerous, and it is dangerous because it could hurt and possibly kill someone.

Venus is our sister planet. Some call us twins because of the sizes we both have. But, Venus is the closest to the sun like Mercury is the first panet next to the sun. So Venus is the warmer part of our sisterhood, and Earth are the cold part of our sisterhood. It's sort of like Venus is Anna because of her warm personality. And earth is like Elsa, because of her frozen powers, so she is extremely cold when it comes down to things. Earth at the moment is like Elsa because of its winter landish time of the year.

To be truthful, trying to go to Venus is a good way to learn more about the planets and to see if there is any living sources out there in the galaxy. But at the same time it's a good way to get killed.(not saying you should do it for the fun of it or for suicide.)

You should at least make some sort of suit that is safe for acid to hit it and so it doesn't melt your suit. It will be pretty cool to finally go to other planets and explore them.

For this entire essay I learned about new stuff. I learned that there is acid rain in Venus. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus, I thought that was cool to learn. I also learned that Mercury is the first planet in front of the sun. I totally forgot about that, so I was surprised. So that's what I learned.","

In the conclusion part it talks about how you are suppose to smile. And putting on happy face works. If you make a happy face you are showing your emotions to other people. I think that a lot people should put on there happy face. Becuase they will be showing there emotions to people. I think that some people don't want to smile becuase they don't like to smile. Or they hate to smile in front of people. I wonder why some people don't want to smile. I think that some people don't want to smile in front people. Becuasue they are afraid to smile in front of people. ]""

F93,"People who like to travel and love horses and cows should join Seagoing Cowboys because they travel all around the world with horses and cows. The Seagoing Cowboys travel on ships going on the Ocean. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you will need to feed over 300 horses and young cows. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you will be on the ocean for about 2 weeks crossing some parts of the sea.

If you join Seagoing Cow boys you will need to treat the workers and the animals with good respect and care for them. When being a Seagoing Cowboy you will need to check on the animals every hour, but when its wet or raining be carefull going down the ladders on the ship beacause you might slip and get really ingured or could die. When going across the ocean you can also have fun stuff to do on the ship.

When feeding and giving the animals water you need to give them food and water 2 or 3 times a day so they can be healthy. Some places you might go to on the ship is China, and Europe. When going to places like that you might see something you had never seen in real life or had ever seen. You can be 17 and older to join Seagoing Cowboys. So join the Seagoing Cowboys.","

""The proccess begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""it also says that we may some times not really know what is wrong with our friends and sometimes we can becaus of there facial expresion. or just behavior in general but sometimes they dont want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.

so i personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldnt really express there selfs to the class as if they were with there friends. so all we would have to do is just by a sinlge glimpes on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happend. and she doesnt really know what to do so she seeks help from a counceler and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. tech is advancing a lot and is helping the sociatey positivley and yet negativlily but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but potive stuff.

F95,"Cars may have some advantages, but the world, would be a better place if we limited car useage. The benifits of limiting our usage of cars is, it will help improve the enviornment, there are healthy alternitves, and not useing cars as much will decrease stress that people have.

Decreasing our car usage will emprove the environment. In the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""  In France they banned even numbered liscence plates from driving, for one day, and one day was all it took for the high levels of smog to decrease. In another Artical ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it talks about the decrease usage of cars throught the years, paragraph 34 says "" If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" If the people keep slowing down on using cars, which scientist believe it will, there will be better carbon e,issions in the air, and the air will be better. Limiting car usage will help make our environment better.

Walking, biking, and skateing are all excercises that help you stay fit, but they are also a healthy alternative to cars. A artical published in the

Seattle Times called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky describes the day that is trending all over the world, the day cars are banned. People in these countries, in this case Colombia ""hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work"" Banning car usage enchourages people to get up and walk, run, or bike because they can't use their car. In the town Vauban, Germany a car free town, people walk everywhere, because the town has no cars. In the town ""...where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" The people in this town are walking and staying fit everyday.

One last benifit of limited car usage is it causes people less stress. Heidrun Walter , a mother of two who lives in Vauban, Germany, says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now."" Once Walter sold her car she was relived, she didn't have to worry about making her next car payment, when she would have to get gas again, or how much money gas was. Getting rid of her car relived her stress. Not using cars will decrease the amount of stress in society.

Over all, limiting are car usage would greatly benifit us, it will help keep the environment clean, keep our people healthy, and it will cause people less stress.                     ","

F96,"Being able to detect how other people are feeling can be a satisfiying and critical thing to use or to know. When the historical and famous picture that was taken of Mona Lisa famouse painting with her smiling can be a miss lead consuption or an unexpected photo at the time. With the FACS it was able to detect Mona Lisa's expression through the photo. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The FACS isnt able to detect what Mona Lisa was happy, upset, angry, disgusted or fearful at the time. The only thing it was able to capture are her feelings but not towards what she was feeling for.

Being able to know that the person that you are analizing can have certain emotion's towards you or towards others is a good thing. If you were to have a significant other or some one that you are intrested in is sending mix signal can be complicated and people wouldn't be able to tell, it can be usefull but, can also be a disadvatage. There are people who tend to be complicated when they aren't wanting to. It would be easy tp know if there were to be a detected FACS. But how would it be for sure that it was towards that one specific person. For instance in the Mona Lisa picture/painting.","

Another Example is that a truck driver can get across the states way easyer. The truck driver has nothing to do but keep his eyes on the road. Wow super easy!

Driverless cars can also be much safer then a real person driving. A examble, is that your tierd after a hard match of friday night football with your team and your left arm is hurting but you still have to drive home you could crash because of the left arm. If you had a driverless car you could get home worry free. A driver less car can make the trip a lot safer.

Driverless cars can helpful in your driving life. An examble, of this well be if a pregent women is at home alone without a phone and her water broke she could use her driverless car to take her to the hospital.

F98,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because in the passage it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger ,disgust, fear and sadness"" based off this piece of evidence the computer that he has designed to detect your emotion will determine how the student is feeling like for example : the sudent is smiling but the smile she has might have a little sadness in her) so the computer can detect that it was a fake smile. Another piece of evidence from the article is ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" based off that statement you can already tell that the technique Dr.Huang created works.

Finally in the passage it states ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" based on that statement if you smile while your lookig into the computer the next ad will be something about happiness but, if you frown while your looking into the computer then the next ad will be something about sadness.

F99,I think that having the use of that technology in a class room. I think it would be a good idea because then teachers would know if something was wrong with the students and they could do something about it. Or if the students were not into the lesson the teachers was teaching and the teachers could try to change the lesson up a bit. It could also be helpful because if the student was sad the teacher would know and could try to help the student out in some kind of way. Or say like if the student was mad and the teacher didnt know the student could lash out of them and that would be bad but with the 3d computer the teacher could find out and could stay out of their way or try to help. Or say there was a bully in the class and the teacher didnt know and they had just made a new seating chart and they put the bully right by one of their victims and the student was scared you could use the 3d computer and check the student and see that he or she is scared you can solve the promblem right there and wouldnt have to worry about in the future. For example say if the teacher had a special day and she wanted to bring the students a treat so she baked some cookies and she brought the cookies to the students when their eating them she could check to see if they are happy and surprise that she brought them some cookies. Or if some of the students showed no the emotion to the teacher bringing them the 3d computer could tell them that. Say for example the students in the class took a test and normally everbody is feeling mad and bored but when they take this test all of them get a B+ or higher you could check the 3d computer and see they were all comfadent and ready for this test. In conclusion the 3d computer would be a good to use in a classroom and something teachers need.,"

F100,"This software is valuable, for the simple fact of i""ve seen alot of photos. knowing whats this painting is feelings can help you understand. In the ""Mona Lisa"" she has diferent emotions going on. Just looking at the painting you woudlnt think that there is any type of emotion, but thats when the machine kicks in.

Mona llisa lacks a big smile, but she 83% happy. If thats the case more paintings need to go thru this machine. Also Mona lisa was 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Just from looking at the painting what would you think? I dont even know what I thought her expressions were. It's hard to tell but this machine helped out alot.

So, yes the software is vaulable, not every day you hear about a machine that calculates emotion. If we had this machines in school you'd know whats wrong with your girlfreind or friend. Reading about this makes me question alot of pictures now. Now i think and ask how many other paintings have a meaning to it.      ","

F101,"Studies have been proven that people are starting to not drive cars as much, Americans are buying fewer cars, and getting fewer licenses. There are several advantages to not driving cars every where, beneficial implications for carbon emissions, the environment and improves safety.

Vauban's streets in germany are completely ""car free."" People who do not drive cars any more and ride bikes, walks or rides the tram are said to be more happier this way. A mother of two walks and rides her bikes every where with her kids and does not feel as tense and stressed as she did when she was driving.

Also a huge advantage is it drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Diesel fuel was banned in France since tax policies favored dieselover gasoline. Delivery companiess complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made, plug-in-cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers.

In Paris there were days of near record pollution, so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below average and equal to the country in January 1995. ""The rate of car ownership per household and per person came down two to three years before the downturn."" Michael Sivak stated. New York has a new bike sharing program and the skyrocketing bridges and tunnel tolls reflect people to want to not drive cars anymore.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, just shows you that the beneficial implications, environment and easier way of saving money does make people want to start biking, walking, using a tram, etc. Those examples I gave you are a few advantages of limiting car use.         ","

F102,"I think the Facial Action Coding System is pretty good, but I think it has a few problem.

The Mona Lisa is a hard painting, because every people have a different opinion about it. For example some people say she is sad, angry, but some people say she is happy. This Facial Action Coding System can help us. It says Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. This program can read by muscles so it can help us if we have painting and we need analys that. It has classifield six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. If we raise our eyebrows then we are surprised. This system can mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. It says we can probably tell how our friend is feeling by the look on her/his face, but it is not always true. I think everybody had experience when she/he was smiling but she/he was sad inside. And I think this program can not read this if we are similing but we are sad inside. It says the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. It could be good if the students bored or confused but a computer never being a human. In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth and it was instruction #1. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around eyes. It was instructions #2. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces do not lie. The emotionals very important in our life. If our friend is sad but if we are positive and we are smiling than maybe he/she will smile.

This technology is pretty good. It has a lot of examples how it is working and it is good if we need to use this program in class. For example analysing painting. But I don not think it always could be analysing human emotionals.","

That is not good to see what are kids emotional expressions the kids don't want any one to know why they are sad or mad about.

F104,"Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because many student will come into the classroom with sad face and nobody will know what is wrong with them but with the Facial Action Coding System, everybody will know what is wrong with a person if he/she is sad in class, And is not everybody that feel happy everyday but with this kind of technology we will be able to know what is wrong with them and we will make sure they feel happy.

In paragraph 5 the author say that in fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""caculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. But some people can tell how a person feel but only the person friend and that is not good but with the Facial Action Coding System evrybody will be able to tell how a person feel not only the person friend.

In paragraph 6 it say that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and that will make the teacher find something that will u feel happy and keep u busy. But without the Facial Action Coding System the teacher will not be able to know what is wrong with a student is either they are confused or bored she won't be able to tell becuase she can't know how the student feel but with the computer the teacher can see if the students are happy or not and they are not happy she will be able to find a way to make them happy.

So the Facial Action Coding System will be valuable in classroom so the teacher can know the feeling of his student.          ","

F106,"Mona Lisa is one of the worlds most famous paintings, but did you know that even though she isnt real computers can still reconize her face and unlock things. In the article ""Mona Lisa Smiles"", by Nick D' Alto he explanes how Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, made a system where computer can reconize your face. Many may argue that the new facial action coding system leads the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable this is shown by, Mona Lisa being able to be reconized by compters even though she's a painting, computer can knowlege the students faces and lastly, the computers can make you happy.

Firstly, Mona Lisa is being able to be reconized by computer even though she is a painting. Dr. Paul Eckman made a system where computers unlock themselves and consisders your emotion by your facial expressiona and the tempertures from your body. Nick states, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D' Alto 1). This quote show that the computers saw her facial expression and determined how she was feeling. It also shows that the computers can see anyones face and unlock any device.

Secondly, computer can reconize their faces and only unlock for the students. The system would be very useful in school because it will determine the students facial expreesion and alert the teacher or the computer if the student needs help or is having a difficult time with their work. Nick states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D' Alto 6). This quotes shows that the teachers will have a easier time teaching and knowing which student will need help by the computer alrting them and showing that they need help.

Lastly, the computer can make the students more happy. Making smiley to your computer can make you more happy. Moving your facial muscels expresses more emotions. Nick states, ""According to Facial Feedback Thoeory of Emotion, moving your facial muscels not only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them"" (D' Alto 9). This quote shows that making faces at your computer can make your emotions change and feel better.

In conclution, computers can help the students and schools just by facial expressions. In todays world we have phones that easily unlock itself just by looking at it. Many may argue that emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable, it is, because it will help the students learn more from the computers knowleging that they need help.

F107,"Its valuable to use a technolgy that can read the emotional expressions of a student. I find it important to know how someone really feels and what they may be going through. For an example, many people hide what they truly feel, because of what others think. I have a great friend that really does not express themselves when we go out and hang, she always seems to be bored. The reality is that she has fun and likes the things I like, She may seem like she is bored, but you can tell when she is enjoying herself, she makes a small smile and looks over to the other side when she does not want me to see that she is having fun.

Having Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa is a great way to tell others an expression of all six basic emotions. The way Leonardo used his painting to get every single muscle to go with its roll in each six basic emotional expression of Mona Lisa.

We all have six basic emotions, which are: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and saddness. It is a surprise knowing when we humans are surprised an expression is shown in our faces, in the third paragraph the author says "" your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow"" when you're surprise. The most common facial expression is happy. In paragraph 7 it talks about how the instructions above were a happy face instuction, it also includes how their is a difference between a real and a false smile. Us humans have real emotional expressions. Our true expression never lie how we truly feel, as said in paragraph 8 "" faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In todays world many people express themselves and many people don't. In the reality many people hide what feel and make a lying expression, with noticeable information on the lying expression. In instance in paragraph 7, with the instuctions of making a smile, Having a false smile is different than a real smile. For example, in paragraph 8 the author talks about the muscle in the smile, "" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make a crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This tells how a false expression can be noticable and yet use to make a lie.

A technology that can read an expression of a student would be great, so that a teacher may know how a student is feeling and can help or observe. As known many famous people lie about how they feel and we as humans are no different than a celebrity. We all have emotion expressions that we express and falsely express to fool someone. Helping the ones who are sad and angry, fear and disgusted to succed and the ones who feel happy to succed as well.

Having the technology that can read emotion expressions in a classroom of student is valuable. Since most students don't want to express their feeling phiscally. These are my reasons why having a technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable.       ","

F110,"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years, different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their ""goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to ""clear the air of the global city."" This is due to ""days of near-record pollution."" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage girl in front of you isn't paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressfull days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.    ","

F112,"I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one. I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall. When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants.

I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a ceratin candiate running for president. By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party."" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.

This does make the candiate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candiate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost. It stated in the article that ""A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.""So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for.

I think the Electoral college is great and well organized the process is good and the only thing is does is make the voting process more easier and ordered. I think we should keep it i mean it has had his troubles her and there but it has worked so good for such a long time. We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well. I hope this is the way we keep on voting i think its great and that changing it would just make things harder on everybody.    ","

F115,"In the artical, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

the author feels that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"", meaning no matter how dangerous Venus really is, he/she thinks it would still be a good idea to explore or even just get a better understanding of Venus.

The author goes into detail on how Venus is one of the closest plants to us, and is even the most earth like plant. They say Venus has vallys, mountins, craters, and even might have had water many years ago. They say how we haven't touch or landed on Venus in a few decades because the atmospher is so dangerous, and he/she wants us to try to be able to have life there on Venus.

The author says that venus is often refered to as earths twin, all because of the fetures it has, he/she then goes on to say that each and every previous misson was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no spacecraft survives a landing on mars for even a few hours. He/she says that Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon, that just covers venus like a blanket, and that the temperature average on venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit with a atmospheric pressur about 90 times greater that on earth. those conditions are much more extreame, and would take much more advanced technology.

So the author says that he/she thinks that exploring venus and being able to have life on venus again would be great, if we can get the technology that is required to be able to get up there and actually be able to land for more then a few hours. He/she also thinks that it would be great to be able to have life on Venus or have that as a back up eath. They go on to give us many deatils on how Venus is unsafe for our technology at the moment, and how hard it would be to get there and stay for a long time, but they also go to say a good start would be being able to just get samples of the gas or the rocks on Venus and jsut move on from that point on.","

F116,"Kat was a twenty-two year old girl who was driving to the store late at night. She had realized that she needed to get her little brother a present for his birthday tomorrow. Kat was tired from a long day of studying for her upcoming collage finals, so it didn't take long for her to pass out at the wheel. Kat's vehicle sped into a tree off to the side of the road. Kat died from her injuries. But imagine Kat had been guiding a driverless car. When Kat fell asleep, the car would have sensed itself going off course and would have corrected its path or woken up Kat. The advantages of a driverless car would apply to more than just Kat's situation. Driverless cars would be a luxury for drivers all around the world due to their advanced safety features, automatic transportation, and convenience to the driver.

The impact that driverless cars could eventually have is exponential. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" has many good points on to what they could do for the world in the future. At one point the article reads, ""...how much smarter did the cars have to be? For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors. The advancement of the sensors used would help to stop many of the car crash deaths in the United States and beyond. The automatic driving feature would give the driver so much time for other things. You could read a book on your way to work, or play a game with the kids while on a roadtrip.

Some say that a driverless car is much too dangerous, and that a machine can never be better than a human. They believe that humans will always be needed to drive cars. This is understandable as a computer driving a car is a foriegn concept. However, they would be wrong in their assumption.

The ""Smart Cars"" being developed today are not more efficient than a human, however, this will most likely not be the case for long. With the current rate of technological development, We will have cars that can drive themselves without human assistance within the next 30 years. The next generation might be used to only learning the very basics of driving, as they might not need that skill.

With all the good that driverless cars could do for the world, it's a wonder anyone questions their value. The potential for safety and convenience is much to high to pass up on. Driverless cars are the future of our roads. Very soon, driverless cars will be sold at car dealerships and open to the public.","

F117,"""Hi my name is Luke I am a Seagoing Cowboy,"" I thought in my head. No, ""How are you today?"" I thought again, ""How are you today, my name is Luke, I am a Seagoing Coybow!"" ""Yes!"" I said outloud. I am trying to convince people to join the Seagoing Coybows program. It is a program about helping others in Europe and give them what they need.

I went up to a boy who looked to be about 18. I told him,""How are you?"" He said,""Im doing horrible, I just lost my job at the bar."" I said,""I am very sorry to hear that, but i have something to offer you, by the way how old are you?"" He said, ""I am 19 years old, but what is this offer you are giving me?"" I said, ""Ok thats good, I am a Seagoing Coybow, we are looking for people that want to help others in Europe by giving them what they need."" He said, ""No way, i've been trying to join the program but I missed the singups, im in, also my name is Gavin!""

I said, ""Glad to hear!"" I also said, ""Do you have any friends or family that want to join the program?"" He said, ""I don't know, hmm, maybe my friend Ben?"" I said, ""Great, do you think you can go on my ride and go to his house if he is home?"" He said, ""Yes, he is home right now!"" I said,""How old is he?"" He said, ""He is 23 years old, met him at my job, we were both fighting over something, but we became friends!""

We both rode in my wagon. We made it to his house. I knocked on the door three times no answer. Then when Gavin knocked on the door in a wierd sort of pattern we could hear footsteps. Ben came down he looked big and strong.

I asked him,""Hey Ben, I have met your friend Gavin today, he is going to be joining the Seagoing Coybows program, are you interested in joining?"" He said, ""No sounds dumb."" I said, ""How is it dumb to help people in need?"" He said, ""I don't wanna help just like I said the first time and I don't care! Ben's mom came downstairs.

She yelled, ""Who is it and what do you want with me and my son!"" I said, ""We are just seeing if he is interested in joining a program!"" She ran downstairs and now we saw her. She was tall and had blue eyes with blonde hair. She said, ""What type of program?"" I said, ""The Seagoing Coybows program, I have made 9 trips across the oceans, the most any Seagoing Coybow has, I was recruited in it in 1945 and it is an amzing job, I have been on many amazing adventures and got to visit cool places, you also help people in need!"" She said the same thing that Ben said.

She said, ""There is no point in doing it!"" I said, ""How is it bad to help people in need?"" She said, ""Why should I care?"" Ben said, ""I know right?"" I said, ""What if you were that person in need and needed food,supplies, and transportation?"" ""Wouldn't you want help? She said, ""I guess your right, son you should sing up seems like a great offer to travel places and help people."" Ben said, ""That's dumb, I don't care about them, I care about me, look I need a haircut and you want me to help people instead that I don't care about at all?""

I said,""I will pay for your haircut and it is an amazing offer just like your mom said!"" He said, ""What would you do in the boats?"" I said, ""You would feed and water the animals, but there is also fun things to do like play volleyball,ping pong,fencing,boxing,and reading!"" He said, ""Sounds good I guess I will join!"" I said, ""Ok great!"" We all left the small town and got on the boats. It was going to be a great adventure!   ","

F118,"Have you ever thought of being the only person in the car, and not having to drive? The idea of self-driving cars have been around since the late 1950's. Yeah, sure, it'd be cool to have a computer automated car, but this would take away the fun of driving.

Then again, it would cost less gas to have a coumputer dive your car for you, but if you wanted not to drive you could just call a taxi or catch a bus. The positive effects of self-driving cars are endless. The negative effects are also there to opose the positives.

Let's say my grandma is physiclly disabled and can't drive, a self-driving car could take her places without her having to call a family member or friend to come assist her. This is one positive effect. Now let's look at another senaro. Let's say it's a very hot day, and everything that's in the direct sun light is over 100 degrees. the sun would eventually fry or over heat the circuts inthe computer programing. The people cooler climates would have same but oposite effects. The wires and electical currents would freeze due to the cold climate.

So would you wanna have a self-driving car, or to drive the car yourself. the positives and negatives show. This is my postions on the ""drverless/self-driving car"". I will stick to traditional driving, with my foot on the pedal and my hands on the wheel.   ","

F119,"I think that it would be a great idea limiting the usage of cars and what the advantages are beacuse when people have cars u hearing about crahes and all the other bad stuff. so a good way to revent al this from happening would be to get rid of car uasage and make people bike or walk to wherever they want to go to. Also limiting the usage of cars would prevent all the bad stuff from happening and help have a safer life and a longer one too.

In source it talks about how their are now cars in germany in the Suburbs. street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden. In the new approach stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some istant highway. Heidrun Walter is a mother of two and use to have a car but sold to move to germany because alot of people alot of people dont have cars and she feels safre their because she knows that her children are going to be safe their. when she drove a car she felt all tense and freaked out. So in germany they tring ti create walking to stores or plaes that are like a block away because they feel like that is the best method.

The adavntages would be that u dont have to worry about getting all thses fines, getting your car impoud and not having to pay the fee. Also when u havea car u have to pay for the car insurance, the gas. Also it wouldnt create any cathos on the road and u would be much safre if the usage of cars went away because u wouldnt have to hear about car accidents that killed people. It would be a stress free world if cars went away. Also an advantage would be that u dnt have to worry about getting stuff stolen.

Ive explained to u that the limiting of cars would be a great idea because then u dont have to worry about all the bad things that could happen to the u if u had a car and u could walk somewhere or bike somewhere and that would be better than cras because it would be safer than a car.                                                                    ","

So in germany they tring ti create walking to stores or plaes that are like a block away because they feel like that is the best method.

The adavntages would be that u dont have to worry about getting all thses fines, getting your car impoud and not having to pay the fee. Also when u havea car u have to pay for the car insurance, the gas. Also it wouldnt create any cathos on the road and u would be much safre if the usage of cars went away because u wouldnt have to hear about car accidents that killed people. It would be a stress free world if cars went away. Also an advantage would be that u dnt have to worry about getting stuff stolen.

Ive explained to u that the limiting of cars would be a great idea because then u dont have to worry about all the bad things that could happen to the u if u had a car and u could walk somewhere or bike somewhere and that would be better than cras because it would be safer than a car.                                                                    ]""

F120,"The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, I strongly disagree because the author did not provided more proofs on why we should go to Venus despite the dangers it presents. The author provided more cons than pros to support his answer.

The author he/she did not provided enough information to support his/her idea on going to Venus.

This shows how the author did not support their own answers insead of providing more pros he/she provided more cons, I strongly disagree that we should go to Venus cause no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours so what makes you think a human can survive that with more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit, so overall I do not think Venus should be worthy pursuit despite it's dangers because no human would survive.

F121,"What make a person wonder about how the other people feel about them? Imagine being able to know exactly how a person feel and their emotion toward you or other things. Dr. Huang, the prof. of the Beakman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, have created a way for us to figure people emotion. He created the Facial Action Coding System. Facial Action Coding System is a system that make you understand a person emotion by the muscles in

their face. The use of this technology to read emotion is valuable for many reason.The reason are that it will make us understand how our friends are feeling, to make sure the politician or celebrity is being truthful, and it help us with our

everyday life.

The first reason is that the Facial Action Coding Stystem will help us understand how our friends feel. According to paragraph 5, and line 2, it stated that "" you can probable tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" There always that friend that doesn't express herself well. If she need help with her life or when she is sad she won't understand how to express these emotion to her friends. This will help the people to understand how they feel and know when they need a shoulder to lean on.

Futhermore, the technology will help the citizen identify whether the politician or the president is being truthful. Paragraph 8, line 4-6, it explain, "" these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful."" If we don't have this type of way to figure out if our politician are worth it, then the world would be a mess. We would never know if that person is very truthful in his or her job. Also it a good way to find that good president that will guide us with real emotion and not a fake one.

The last reason is that the tecnology will help us with our everyday life. According to

the last paragraph, it stated that "" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.(""Putting on a

happy face"" actually work!)"" When we have work or when

go out it always important to have a happy face. When you look mad and depressed, other people around you will know and they will judge you. Having a happy face will make the other think highly of you. You will be able to get along with your co-worker very well. It to make your life easier and better.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System is valuabe because it allow you to understand your peers emotion, when a politician is being truthful, and help you make many friend. Some may argue that it personal and it not our buisness to know how a person feel. In order to make our world better, everyone should understand each other emotion for it to be easier to communicate. Other will understand and make this world peaceful.","

F122,"It is a good technology to have. People can lie about how they feel. In the painting of Mona do u really know she was happy. No a comupter can say that but it a painting of the person that is not around. So you don't know it just he face everyday. She has no eyebrows so how can you so she is suprised. In the text it says your eyebrows Well you cant have that if there isn't any.

So thing that it is a good technology to have but it just not proven to work on paint. The students don't realy need to know how to use a computer to see how people are feeling. People most of the time you can tell by looking on there faces. Why is it important to know picture or a painting is feeling when you look at it should do it for you. How do you say she is 83 percent happy you can't put that like it a math problem. Because you don't know how see really feels because it could just be a face for all we know.

That is why I think is would be worthless for students to use it. They cant use a comupter to see how someone is feeling inside them. It is a good advancement and can be use but in another way. People can hide how they are feeling just by there face. It also not something students need to learn to go far in life.","

Cars in the modern day are playing a huge role in many people everday lives, most even depend on the car to move on with the ir days. What most don't know is that the use cars provide more issuse within their daily lives than not using them. for example a mother of two from vauban, germany states that "" when she used a car everyday she used to be very tense, and now that she has given away her car theat she is much happier"". scientist have proven that "" having to keep a car up and running, and dealing with all of the maintence that comes with it is casing many families to begin pinching pennies"".

F124,"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe.  In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as  people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban (the car- free city) has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the enviroment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the enviroment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rush-hour every day.  Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.                  ","

F125,"Today is the day where children are coming to tour NASA. As I am walking around, I think of questions the children might ask. ""Who was the first person on the moon?"", is the most frequently asked question. Then I remember that there is a new part in NASA's building. Recently, they added photos and information on the ""Face on Mars"". I think to myself, ""This should definately intrest the children.""

Soon enough, a little yellow bus pulled into the parking lot. Five children came tumbling out, all excited to see what is indoors. ""Asher, stop it!"", a little brown haired girl yelled. As soon as they were all out, the stood in a straight line, covering their eyes from the sun while looking at the huge building. I look the children's faces. I only know one child, because another said his name.

""Welcome to NASA. We are so very glad you guys could come. Please, let me introduce myself. I am Maddie, and I will be showing you around today. Follow me inside, so we can get out of this dreadful heat!"", I say. The five children come chasing after me, and their teacher tells them to slow down. One by one, the children enter the building, fascinated by all the pictures hanging from the walls. Asher asks, ""Are aliens really real?"". As I go to respond, the little brown haired girl says, ""Of course not. That's just in movies. I want to know about the Face on Mars."". I was stunned she knew about that, because it was just recently added on NASA's walls.

I lead the children to the elevator, which just so happened to be across the room. ""Let's go and see the Face on Mars. I think I should tell you about it first. The Face on Mars is a natural landform which-"" I was then interupted by a new face. ""It is not a natural landform, my sister told me that it was created by the aliens."" I give her a puzzled look and respond, ""We have not found any form of life on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, excluding Earth. As I was saying, the Face on Mars in a natural landform which means that it happened naturally. It was not made by any aliens"". The girl looked at me, frusterated, and said, ""Prove it.""

The elevator door opens and the children come swarming out, running up to the pictures of the Face. I say, ""Here, it says that the Face is a ""huge rock formation"", so that means that when the universe was created, so was that rock. That rock is just shaped like a head."". All of a sudden, the young girl smiled and said, ""Oh, I can't wait to tell my sister that she was wrong!""

The children wrote everything I told them down in their notebooks. Shortly, we had to part and say goodbye. The kids all came up and hugged me, saying that they were thankful for getting chosen to come. They piled back into the bus this time, instead of piling out. I waved goodbye as they set off.

In conclusion, the kids all realized that the Face, is just a natural landform, made when Mars was created or after. The children know that still to this day, we are looking all over the universe to find something new and exciting to share with them. I am so gald that they could come and experience this with us.

I only know one child, because another said his name.

""Welcome to NASA. We are so very glad you guys could come. Please, let me introduce myself. I am Maddie, and I will be showing you around today. Follow me inside, so we can get out of this dreadful heat!"", I say. The five children come chasing after me, and their teacher tells them to slow down. One by one, the children enter the building, fascinated by all the pictures hanging from the walls. Asher asks, ""Are aliens really real?"". As I go to respond, the little brown haired girl says, ""Of course not. That's just in movies. I want to know about the Face on Mars."". I was stunned she knew about that, because it was just recently added on NASA's walls.

I lead the children to the elevator, which just so happened to be across the room. ""Let's go and see the Face on Mars. I think I should tell you about it first. The Face on Mars is a natural landform which-"" I was then interupted by a new face. ""It is not a natural landform, my sister told me that it was created by the aliens."" I give her a puzzled look and respond, ""We have not found any form of life on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, excluding Earth. As I was saying, the Face on Mars in a natural landform which means that it happened naturally. It was not made by any aliens"". The girl looked at me, frusterated, and said, ""Prove it.""

The elevator door opens and the children come swarming out, running up to the pictures of the Face. I say, ""Here, it says that the Face is a ""huge rock formation"", so that means that when the universe was created, so was that rock. That rock is just shaped like a head."". All of a sudden, the young girl smiled and said, ""Oh, I can't wait to tell my sister that she was wrong!""

The children wrote everything I told them down in their notebooks. Shortly, we had to part and say goodbye. The kids all came up and hugged me, saying that they were thankful for getting chosen to come. They piled back into the bus this time, instead of piling out. I waved goodbye as they set off.

In conclusion, the kids all realized that the Face, is just a natural landform, made when Mars was created or after. The children know that still to this day, we are looking all over the universe to find something new and exciting to share with them. I am so gald that they could come and experience this with us. ]""

F126,"Introduction-

People, Muesums, and Schools are still wandering ""to this day"" if Leonardo Da Vinci made his famous painting of Mona Lisa with a smile on ""her"" face, well, in Paragraph 1(Lines 1-2), there is a descripion of how Nick D'Alto is saying that Mona Lisa is Eighty-Three percent happy, Nine percent disgusted, Six percent fearful, and Two percent angry. The new technology system being described in the

Facial Action Coding System (suggested by Dr. Huang) could possibly make a big difference of how Mona Lisa ""REALLY FEELS"", and how it would be easier for students to learn about whether or not ""She"" was made ""HAPPY"" in Da'Vinci's paintings.

Body Paragraph-

Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks ""in the dark!"" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with ""2020 Vision Software"", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology. I think that this kind of technology is kind of un-realistic, but it would be a good source for what the person studying in will thinks about what he learned in the past ""Once enough of the Life-Story of the person has gone by."" In Paragraph 3 ""Lines 18-31"", I would imagine that constructing a computer that has a lot of functions and features could lack the knowledge of a person's understanding of how to ""USE"" the computer properly, which will turn out to be more like ""TRASHWARE"" than ""SOFTWARE"". The biggest part I think the Facial Action Coding System ""Is Worth"" is how you can just control anything in your ""IMAGINATION"" to discover the strong ways that you can make video games from your imagination, show how you truly feel, and picture yourself "" in that video game."" Dr. Huang is not a bad ""Pre- Innovator"", but he could have added specific date(s) to his context.

Conclusion-

If a type of computer with 3-D software were to exist, then there would be a great possibility that by Two- Thousand Twenty, there will be the greatest chance of a computer with special features existing ""if Dr. Huang will start planning how the computer he's wishing to come out will be invented.""","

F127,"Have you ever wishes you could read the emotions of another person? With new technology created by Thomas Huang you can do just that. This device allows you to precicly calculate the emotions and feelings of anoother person. But would it be valuable in a classroom of students.

In my personal opinion i say yes it would be valuable. I think it would not only be valuable to students but also to teachers. It would be helpfull to students because say for example you have a crush on a fellow classmate but dosent know how she feels about you with a app called snapchat you are able to communicate through pictures, so if you knew how she felt about the conversation based on the selfie she sent it would give you a accurate idea of how she feels about you. A reason i think it would be helpfull to teachers is it would allow them to know when a kid becomes bored or sleepy ultimatly helping on how to teach and what subjects catches your class attention.

So do i think that it is a good idea to have a emotion detector in a classroom. Over all yes because it has it's pro's such ass helping a student with his crush or helping a teacher deliver a lesson planor know when a student it sleeping. But it can also have its con's. So when deciding to put one in a classroom of your own dont only look at the neggatives or posotives but compare and see which outways the other.          ","

F128,"It's incredible how the technology is able to know your emotions. It's like the techonology is trying to communicate with us, but will it be useful for school and teachers? In this passage I'm going to tell you, why having the technology is valuable and useful for school and teachers.

The use of this technology that is able to read the emotional expressions of studnets in a classroom is valuable becuase it's important that the teachers know the emotions that her students. This technology can help the teachers understand the students btter for example, the teacher is giving a lesson the teacher needs to know if they're bored or confused so he or she can do something about his or her lessons.

If the students are bored then he or she can change the ways they teach, by adding some fun activities to try and keep thier students attention, enocourage students to learn and pay attention to what the teacher is teaaching. If the student is confused then the teacher can try and help the students by giving them more examples and talking about the topic more. Having this sort of technology is great becuase many of the students don't want to ask their teacher for help when they're confused in a certain topic. The students might be afraid that the teacher might get displeased or made fun of from the other students.

In the text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""A classromm copmputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". It says that the computer can read the students emotions when they are bored an confused, like I said before.

In conclusion, Using this sort of technology would help many teachers and many schools because they would know how his or her students feel. Also, help them with thier lessons and way of teaching. Creating new ways to teach and enocurage the students to learn and be in school.      ","

F130,"Seagoing Cowboys

Just like Luke people should become seagoing Cowboys.

People should join this force because it's fun not only fun it helps you explore the world, like New Orleans, Greece , Venice, and even China. I'm sure there is many more places Luke visited and just didn't talk about.

Boeing a seagoing cowboy isn't always about fun and games. Sure that's one thing but it's also a duty. It's a duty to get you're animals from one country to another, or farmers wouldn't have cattle, butchers wouldn't have cows,etc. but without them some countries wouldn't have cows, mules, and horses. Even know it's a duty seagoing cows are always helping in they're own way. They get animals from one place to another but they are also kind. I'm sure if someone was having a bad day and to pick up a horse, the seagoing Cowboys were there to help.

So please take this information and spread it to others we need more seagoing Cowboys. They are important, thank you for reading. And take my advice and become a seagoing cowboy with your own free will.","

F134,"A world of less pollution, less costly wages, reduced congestion on the roads, healthier ways to venture around, and less stress and danger. That would be a world with limiting car usage. May not seem like a rational idea but when you see all the good that could come out of the reduction of cars on the streets it could change your way of thinking.

A city in Germany by the name of Vauban, 70 percent of their families do not desire to have cars. Over half of the percentage of people had sold their cars just to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Those were the words of a women by the name of Heidrun Walter who is a mother of two and is also a media trainer she finds bicycles and sound of children running about is a much more tolerant tone then the sound of a motor rolling by. The enviromentalists from the Enviromental Protection Agency favors the idea of car reduction. They stand for cars being limited would reduce pollution and be more friendly the mother earth. From the reduction of cars on the roads the congestion percent soared down a plump number of 60 percent. That's truely a magnificent amount.

I strongly believe that limitng the car usage would reduce death rates, reduce smog, put people in less tense moods keeping them more happy, and lastly reduce moeny going to greenhouse gas wages. More places worldwide should limit relying so much on cars, to allow us to function in daily life without them.    ","

F136,"I think driverless cars are a good thing because it would take so much pressure off the driver him/herself. What i mean by pressure is moving around wrecks or moving slowly through traffic without bumping another car. it would aslo make it easier for the driver to not hit anybody like a crosswalk or constrution zone.

Another from of pressure that is on the driver is passengers. If a mom has just picked up her two children and they are fighting or crying in the back seat the driverless car would take over so she could attend to her fighting for crying children in the backseat. If you go out with your friends to ""party"" and end up not sutable to drive you can have the driverless car take over as well.

People are saying that driverless cars are bad thing because there are more wrecks and more people are dying in these wrecks. I think they are a good thing because if the driverless cars are causing wrecks that gives the manufactures more clues on how to make the cars safer.People also say that theyre bad because people are dying in these wrecks, I say dont worry about it because people are dying everyday.

Lets face it some people arent the best drivers in the world. so why not have driverless cars to help with those type of people. Some people get distracted or get tired, these cars will help with that. If you get distracted you have a car that will drive itself while you text or look at something on the side of the road. You and your family are going on vacation far away and you get tired, locate a hotel that is near had have the car assist you on your way to the hotel.

In conclusion I think driverless cars are a good thing to have because it would help out so many people that either cant drive, get distraced or just get bored of driving all together. Its just another step towards the future. ","

F138,"""Honey, could you go to the CVS and get me some nyquil.

I'm dying here,"" mom says.

""Yeah, I'll be back in a bit.""

I grab my keys from my pocket and head outside. I unlock my new driveless car and climb in. ""Take me to the CVS,"" I tell the car. It roars to life and backs out of the parking lot. It's been not even two miles and this thing is starting to glitch. ""You will be taking possesion of this car in five minutes, ma'am,"" the car commands. I panic and take hold of the violently shaking steering wheel. Traffics harsh tonight meaning there's some kind of party out in town. The driveless car just unexpectedly starts going in the wrong direction, making me go in shock.

Before I do a full turn I see a lady talking to her baby inside the car. I try to brake, but it just won't budge. I pray that I won't do any harm to them. Unfortunetly it does. I run smack into the front rear, making me black out. They say that before you die, your life flashes back through your eyes. But mine didn't.

I instintly think of mom, dying there in her room, waiting for me to come back. But I won't and this is all because of this driveless car. As you can see driveless cars are not safe because it can harm people, it's new technology is very unfamiliar, and it is not as driveless as you think.

Millions of people will die if you provide them with these cars. If you think harm is done only to you, then you are wrong. You can injure lots of people with only one lifeless car. A car with a mind that could turn into your enemy. It might seem a great idea to most of all over social media, but once they buy them then you will harm then. Not only will they sue the company, but have a bad record on there shoulders.

As you can see, new technology can be very unpredictable.

You won't know what is in this bizzare car that is being monitored with itself. And as the article says, it will also monitor you.

I think that this is not just crazy but scary too. And with this new technology you won't learn to handle a car by yourself, and I would want to.

These driveless cars you've been hearing about aren't always true.

It will say that it drives itself. It will eventually come to some point where the car can't handle the heavy traffic and pass it on to you. Yep that's right, you get to control a car that does not want to be handled.

A driveless car is a facade for hidding the real truth. Because that's what it's doing.

Hiding the truth.

These driveless cars I've been telling you about won't make this world any better.

Imagine Earth being invaded by robots. That's right, the new apacolypse. You see these can be extremely dangerous to the environment and the people inside the car. This new technology can't be acurate. There can be some huge change in it that you won't see it coming from two inches away.

And this driveless car being controlled but not by its driver is a false fact. You will eventually drive it too. But this new experiment may be the cause of not returning to your home and giving your mom that nyquil that she wanted so badly because she was dying.

Do you want that?        ","

F139,"The author supports the idea of studying Venus well because he/she provides excellent evidence and data to support his/her claim. The auhor's reason as to why he/she wants to study Venus is because Venus is the most Earth-like planet and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an idea to send humans to Venus.

The author uses the evidence that Venus is the most Earth-like planet because Venus has some features close to Earth. The reasoning is that, from paragraph four, Venus has a rocky surface that has features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This is great evidence because it helps prove the point that Venus was a planet like Earth and that connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author uses the evidence that NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus because NASA has a project that will allow scientists to float above Venus. The author's reasoning is that, in paragraph five, NASA came up with the idea of a vehicle hovering over Venus and it will allow the scientists to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. This is great evidence because it will prove that scientists do not need to get harmed in order to study Venus, which connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author supports the idea of studying Venus well because he/she provides excellent evidence and data to support his/her claim, which the evidence is that Venus is the most Earth-like planet and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an idea to send humans to Venus. The author adds great reasoning to that evidence which proves points that support the idea that Venus is worth studying; Venus was a planet like Earth and scientists do not need to get harmed in order to study Venus.

""[Essay Content: F139 / The author supports the idea of studying Venus well because he/she provides excellent evidence and data to support his/her claim. The auhor's reason as to why he/she wants to study Venus is because Venus is the most Earth-like planet and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an idea to send humans to Venus.

The author uses the evidence that Venus is the most Earth-like planet because Venus has some features close to Earth. The reasoning is that, from paragraph four, Venus has a rocky surface that has features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This is great evidence because it helps prove the point that Venus was a planet like Earth and that connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author uses the evidence that NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus because NASA has a project that will allow scientists to float above Venus. The author's reasoning is that, in paragraph five, NASA came up with the idea of a vehicle hovering over Venus and it will allow the scientists to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions.

F140,"Everybody wants privacy. Sometimes it is a good thing to leave a person alone, whether he or she is feeling sad, happy or angry. Using this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students is not valuable.

There might come a time when a person is sad because he or she has lost a loved one. That person probably would not want anyone knowing how he or she is feeling at the moment. If a computer is used to understand his or her emotions, it could cause that person to be more upset or sad. The computer could acknowledge emotional expressions, but it still has yet to learn how to respond in a situation where that person needs help. In paragraph six, the author states that a computer can know whether you're feeling happy or sad, confused or bored. In school, when a student needs help, the person can just raise his or her hand to get help from the teacher. A computer will most likely use complicated words to modify the lesson.

The problem is the new technology can read emotions, but it cannot really understand the person as much as a human being can. On most of the paragraphs in this article, paragraph eight for example, the author describes about how the computer looks at facial expression to understand someone's emotion. In school, there are shy kids who are afraid to ask for help. Normally, those shy kids are smart students who get good grades. It is true that one cannot just assume all shy kids are smart. But in this case, it is more likely that a shy student will ask help from a teacher, who can understand him or her a little bit better, than a computer that can just read facial expressions.

This technology could also end friendships or relationships. In paragraph seven and eight, the author mentioned that the computer can recognize the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. This would mean that there is no way to hide your emotions. For example, two friends get in an argument because one person was jealous of the other one. In most cases, that jealous person could have hidden his or her emotions, but with the new technology, the other person will know. Sometimes, it is a good thing to be able to hide emotions and feelings from other people.

Using technology that can read students' emotional expressions is not a good idea. For one, it is most likely a computer will not do a better job at teaching students than a human teacher. Also, computer cannot show empathy to someone who is going through a tough time. Last but not least, this technology programmed to be helpful could unintentionally end friendships or relationships. Computers may be useful in many cases, but they can never really do as much as humans.          ","

F141,"Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to bad until there comes a day where you want no one knowing how you're feeling. In the article, the author explains what this technology can do. So far, the article does a job identifying your emotional expressions, ""according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I am against the value of using this technology to read students thoughts or feelings. There are days when you want your own thougths and feelings kept to yourself, privacy, and as well as being able to learn something new everyday.

There come days when you don't want peope knowing how you're feeling and for some odd technology to just assume your feelings is just not adding up to me. The article shows a picture of the young Mona Lisa sort of smiling. Yes, she doesnt seem to happy, but is she? Only she knows. I dont agree with the computer system judging her feelings. ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfull, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto 1). To me, she looks like she's being forced to smile but like I said, only she knew her feelings while the picture was being taken. I don't believe that should be a thing, no one should be told how they are feeling. If we as humans dont really have a reason to judge, why should technology be able to.

Along with that, the article talks about ""a classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 1). Recognizing it could allow teachers to change their lessons, due to students being bored. How come? Daily there are students who complain about how boring a class is. No one forces them to come. Students come to school to learn, we don't expect to have fun. If a technology were to let teachers know when students were bored they'd be changing subjects seconds, by seconds. Students in that case, would be happy to act bored just for the sake of it. Less learning would accure if it were for the technology to detect kids who don't care about school who are constantly ""bored"". No one said school is fun, but neither should a technology detecting students feelings should get in the way of learning.

In the meantime, we have trouble understanding people. To allow a technology to have the power to easily understand thoughts, feelings of us humans is just critical. Allowing a technology to determine your friend's feelings is overrated according to my calculations. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisly enough to convey specific emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I don't believe something so ordinary could barge in and make us feel disturbed knowing not someone but something knows the way we're feeling.

Therfore, I am against this value of using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions. I believe there are different types of people in this world. There are days where you don't want to share your feelings to people, so why technology. If we are willing to share our thoughts, we will. Not have something so unusal do that job for us.                                                ","

F142,"To just put it bluntly, the Electoral College is a huge waste of time and pointless processing. It is completely unfair to the voters, who most of the time feel as if they're voicing their opinion for no reason since it doesn't even get taken into consideration. The whole concept of the electoral college in it's entirety is irrational.

Some people want to be part of this country and participate in one of it's biggest most known events, choosing the president but with the electoral college in our way like a stone wall preventing us from voicing our opinions makes it slightly impossible. Although I must state that the Electoral College does help avoid run-off elections according to source 3 by Richard A. Posner, parahgraph 22. This country is practically split into halves, meaning if two canidates won by popular vote but each had around the same percentage of votes the Electoral College would choose an obvious winner avoiding run-off elections and not complicating things further. That still doesn't change the fact of how unfair it is to the voters.

""Abolish the electoral college!"" said by Bob Dole in source 2 by Bradford Plumer. Yes I agree, abolish it, tear it down to smithereans, bury it into the ground never to resurface again. The electoral college is like planning a family trip, the youngest sister wants to go to Ohio while her brother wants to go to California, they tell the oldest sister of these two location ideas and the sister goes off telling the mom to go to New York, completely ignoring the other two suggestions. In this scenario the two youngest children are the citizens while the oldest sister is the electoral college, thus making the electoral college irrational, injustice, and unfair. It can be argued that the electoral college does help in some aspects like the certainty of outcome described in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, paragraph 18. But some certainty doesn't go a long way, there can be various faults in this certainty.

In my very argued opinion the electoral college is an outdated system usually old men like to stick to because they're afraid of change. Change is good, especially change that can pave the way to choosing better presidents and giving citizens more of a voice in our country, some of us just need a little nudging. Get rid of this annoying process, in with the new and out with the old.                                                                                                            ","

F143,"There was one cloudy morning in a Monday afternoon. The day was a busy day. It came to Tamala's (one of Professer's scientists) attention about the ""The Face on Mars"". She showed the scientist, Professer Lryc while she was observing a sick frog, new high-resoultion images and 3D altmetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.

""What is this that you are showing me?"", said Professer Lyrc

""Well, said Tamala. This is Viking photos from a Mars Global surveyor from 1976, 1998, 2001.""

Professer looks puzzled. It came to her attention that she learned about this from college. She remembers that she did a project on this long time ago.

""Very interesting, said Professer. I think we should have a discussion about this.""

""You think."", said Tamela

""Yes, because this is very interesting.""

So, Tamela called everyone to come to the court room to discuss the interesting news.

"" Ms.Tamela, I was really trying to get my project over with."", said Niguel

"" No time for that right now Niguel, said Professer. We have some business to discuss. Now Ms. Tamela has some business to tell you. And it is very interesting.""

""So, you know I was looking all over the internet about Mars, said Tamela. And I have found this."" Tamela struggles to turn the projector on. After a couple of seconds it show the photos. The visitors were looking surprised and confused.

""That looks familar."" said Niguel.

""Very familar. Is it the...the...um?', Sam hesatated.

""Face on Mars?"", said Dave.

""Yes, it is. Thanks Dave. said Tamela. So I've called everyone here because...I believe this is real."" Everyone gasp.

"" How can you prove that, Ms. Tamela."", said Professer.

""Well, Professer, Tamela explains. Twenty-five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's VIking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called...Cydonia.""

""Wow, so that's what you researched."", said Professer.

"" Basically, Tamela said. The ""Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio shows, even haunted grocery checkout lines for 25 years!""

""Oh really."", said Professer.

""Some people think the Face is ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rater hide."", said Tamela.

Professer looks surprised. "" Any final words. Because I have a class in four minutes."", said Professer.

""Oh, what the picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around th American West. That's what I've learned.""

""Okay, round of applause.""

Everyone claps. Tamela really gave some good interesting news.    ","

F144,"I'm going to type an essay about an arugement for this technology to read students emotional expressions. The newest software update is called Facial Action Coding System. I really feel like this type of technogoly would be really helpful.

There is a lot of prons and cons to this technogoly because some students may not want you to know how they are feeling or what there emtions are, I feel as if some students need the help or may feel, let's say lonely but don't like saying they are so they fake a smile but those are the students who really need someone to know. So I'm going ot start out in my first paragraph saying why I think it would be good to have this type of system.

My first paragraph is going to be my first reason why I feel that it would help and a little bit about the software. The software update has promising applications for a variety of industries. The computer constrcuts a 3-D computer model of the face all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. I feel that it will help a lot more with young teenagers in our generation.

A lot of people in our generation are going through depression and they don't like to telling people about it, so if you have this software it would help kids from sucide thoughts or some things like that.

Another reason why it woud be helpful is because you could use it on anyone not just students. My first reason why I think it would be a brillant idea would be an example such as this, if you went to class one day and seen your friend upset you would be able to look at her and know shes upset but if you asked her and she said no I'm fine, she would be lying. If you had this software update and you used it on your friend it would say she is 70 percent upset and 30 percent mad. So now you know she is upset most of the time and you could change that by talking about things with her letting her parents know. Little things like that could change someones life forever.

My last reason I think it would be helpful is because you would know how everyones feeling. The Mona Lisa is to demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showoing how much a computer can do. It also says in paragraph 6 that ""

A classroom computer could recogonize when a student is becoming bored or confused"". That could also help the teacher out a lot. Some students don't always let the teacher know if they are bored or confused because maybe they are scared or embarssed, but now your teacher would know if you were confused about something. She would be able to help you or do something a little more exciting.

My conclusion paragraph is going to wrap up my essay. As I said in the introduction I think this would be a really good idea for this software update to be in classrooms for teacher and students. I think it would help with teenagers. I gave a couple reasons why I would want this software update or why it would help. I have seen a lot of students falling asleep in class and the teacher just keeps going. I have also been one of those students were I'm really confused but I don't want to say in front of the class so I either don't say anything or I say something to my buddy next to me. Those are my reasons why I am for this Facial Action Coding System.                  ","

""[Essay Content: F144 / I'm going to type an essay about an arugement for this technology to read students emotional expressions. The newest software update is called Facial Action Coding System. I really feel like this type of technogoly would be really helpful.

There is a lot of prons and cons to this technogoly because some students may not want you to know how they are feeling or what there emtions are, I feel as if some students need the help or may feel, let's say lonely but don't like saying they are so they fake a smile but those are the students who really need someone to know. So I'm going ot start out in my first paragraph saying why I think it would be good to have this type of system.

F145,"Technology can be good uses for a lot of things in life espiecally for emotional,mental,and physical reasons. Technology has came a long way for many years and it becomes better every single day. Some people think technology is a bad thing but it actually does a lot for people and different sitautions in life. Expression can increase your emotion just as simple as a smile or a quick laugh.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could help improve someones emotional state by quickly seeing what their emotions are and if they are feeling down you can give them a hug and increase their emotions. If the Facial Action Coding System was a real life tool we could see many changes in peoples behaviors as well. Having a good behavior can make a good impact on your life and also a good reputation. The world can be seen as a different place if we all have good behaviors and good emotions because people will be a lot respectful and mindful of other human beings.

If someone used the Facial Action Coding System on other artist's pictures they could see how they felt at the time during the picture. Back when Mona Lisa got her picture taken she could have expierenced many emotions and no one truly knew how she was feeling but now that there is technology people easily can tell how she truly felt. As of today many people are left in their feelings and they don't know how to talk about their problems so they just keep them inside. With the technology it would help a lot of people express their feelins without feeling embarassed or scared. ","

F147,"The author emphasis how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is very important to Astronomers. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" mainly supports how Venus is worth the riskand challenge to explore to see if it's as much like Earth as it's said to be, because it is close to Earth in size and density, has similiar geographics, and is known as Earth's sister planet.

First, Venus is set up with similar distancing as Earth it's sometimes often referred to as ""Earth's twin"". The text says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Venus is so similar to Earth, but yet so challenging to explore.

Second, just like Earth Venus has mountains and valleys. Some might even say long ago there were oceans, because the text says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth.""

Then, Venus is known to be Earth's sister planet! Venus has always been the closest planet to Earth other than Mars, but if Venus is so much like Earth astronomers can't figure out why it's so much more inhospitable than Earth.

In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging place to see and be. Venus has not been touched in more than 30 years! In the text it says "".. not a singlr spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" So although Venus is the sister of Earth astronomers know very little about her. So they keep in pursuit to learn more despite the dangers it presents everytime.         ","

F148,"Dear Senator,

I believe the way the American Goverment is run is injust and outdated. I believe this because the way we as America elect a new president is unfair to many people.

The reason I say that is the electoral college is unjust is 538 people should'nt be voting for more than a billion people. The way I believe our new President should be selected is by a majority rule, which ever Canidate has the most votes should win not based off people who vote for our state we live in. Even though the majority of the time the representative from his or her state votes depending on the popular vote from there state, but the reason im saying this is that he or she has the power to pick whatever he or she wants. Also another reason would be that the people only vote for a slate whether it be democratic or republic people in the slate can just change there mind and pick a differnt side. I would understand this system before our time but now we have so much technology people can vote from anywhere they dont have to go put a paper in a box anymore. The system is outdated and unfair to many people. Some people would argue against the point that the representative votes depending on his or her states popular vote, but there has been and will be more of the representative picking against his state if it stays like this.

If this actually ever does get to you I hope you take into consideration some of the points I have given you. Like I said before the Electoral College system is outdated and unfair.    ","

F149,"Driveless cars are coming isn't that great? What will the world be without drivers? Are their going to be people who will forget how to drive? Or is driving going to become an unnatural part of the human society?

The idea of having cars that drive by themselves seems wonderful. Personally I'm against that were going to have driveless cars. For example if one day the system fails, who are we going to blame.? Also whos going to be at fault, and how are the damags going to be solved or payed for. Througout time soon this will become a conterversial deal.

Secondly, are people just going to forget how to be independent and drive, or are they going to start relying on a computer to make all their decesions? As a driver myself I would'nt like a car taking me places without taking a hold of the wheel. Just imagine a driveless car will take all the enthusiasum out of driving.

Lastly, since technology is getting so advanced now in days and hackers are also coming along with the cyber world, the chances of getting kidnapped or fraud can increase. For example, lets say that a person needs to go somewhere by taxi. The taxi picks that person up and takes her to the correct destination, and when the time comes to pay she pulls out her debit card and swipes it. But instead of taking the correct amount a hacker takes all the money from her debit card. That again is fraud. Or lets say the instead of the driverless car taking her home, it drives out to an unkown part of the city and shes never seen again. Thats a perfect example of kidnapping. Therefore the security system will also have to increase.

In concluion, this technology would be great have abd a very useful tool that people can use. But it can aslo become an issue with society bringing up many issues. Especially if some people are going to try an use it for the bad. I would recommened to limit the time that would use driverless cars.","

F150,"Our population is booming and with it, our car industry. Cars have provided us with mulitple pros for example, getting us places more quickly, and transportation of goods and services is more efficient. We have to know though that with every good follows a bad, and our beloved cars might not be as great as we belive them to be! Pollution from cars has affected our enviornment severley, we have thousands of accidents daily, and we are stressed due to traffic congestion and daily driving. So, limitting car usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out.

Our enviornment has been infected with toxic greenhouse gasses, and carbon emmisions which comes from our cars' tailpipes. Mixed with rain, the pollution causes a heavy smog making it nearly impossible for people to even see what is right in front of them making it very dangerous. We are now forced to hold days where no one is able to use their own cars because the pollution is so bad. Arturo Plaza explains that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. (Par 24)"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy how much better it is living in a cleaner enviornment! It is much healthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. She explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drasitcally reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. (Par 5)"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Everyday we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so why add on any more? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on how other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substancioully. Heirun Walter is a civialian in a town with no car usage. She explains that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. (Par 3)"" Even though she is a mother of two and a media trainer, she is able to live a life less stressed without her own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard with out them having to worry about the passing cars. Heidrun Walter explains that she can walk down the streets where the  sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. ( Par 3)""

We can help ourselves and our enviornment by limitng our car usage daily! Limiting usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be healthier, and live a better life.            ","

(Par 24)"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy how much better it is living in a cleaner enviornment! It is much healthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. She explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drasitcally reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. (Par 5)"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Everyday we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so why add on any more? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on how other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substancioully. Heirun Walter is a civialian in a town with no car usage. She explains that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. (Par 3)"" Even though she is a mother of two and a media trainer, she is able to live a life less stressed without her own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard with out them having to worry about the passing cars. Heidrun Walter explains that she can walk down the streets where the  sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. ( Par 3)""

We can help ourselves and our enviornment by limitng our car usage daily! Limiting usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be healthier, and live a better life.            ]""

F151,"cars, they wernt invented in the old days. who needs them, not me. screw cars. Ill tell u what u need to know about life and transportation. We can limit car use if u just use this information and use it in your life.

paris has so much smog. Ew!!! No one likes that so lets limit car use. paris has 147 micrograms of matter in cubic meter measurement. Dang taxes! I hate soccer moms, my mom is one so i cant hate them too much. All they do is drive everywhere and use up all the resources so there kid can strike out in little leauge! Now i will tell you how to fix this problem.

if some of the stupid soccer moms driving around there rolling egg (mini van) the car use would be cut in half. Then you might say then what is my little kid going to do. You can read a biycle places just like it said in line 24 of ""car-free day spinning into a big hit bogota. Now ill tell you what kind of bike and what your gonna do with it and your gonna love it!

A bmx bike is what im talking about. you can transportate it to the skatepark to ride the ramps. Its really fun and i love it. Those gas using Mini vans would be off the streets and bmx bikes can take over. Think about our earth for once please.

well to conclude things up car use is oversused highly. It is mainly the soccer moms fault. To fix all the problems in the world everyone needs to get a bmx bike and go ride some dirt jumps and this world would be a happier place!!!    ","

F152,"I disagree with this use of technology beacause i think we are relying too much on tech. Today we use so much technology that we are taking a test on a computer that used to be on paper! I worry that if we were to have a nationwide powersurge we'd be sitting ducks. but a couple decades earlier I think we could have been alright. When you are talking with someone you shouldn't rely on tech to tell you how they're feeling, personally I think it's inhumane. I should be able to look at someone and by they're expression (which the computer reads) I myself alone should be able to tell what they are feeling, and if not then you can ask them with your words like a human being would. We aren't robots we don't need to ask siri how are loved ones are feeling. It completely takes away the joys of bonding and in the case of mona lisa, the elegance of mystery. I personally love art and portraits because it's fun to try and figure out what they are thinking and then ask someone else what they think because that person might have a different idea. Using technology would take away peoples idea to different veiw points of the same portrait. I think we should rely on ourselves to figure out what mona lisa is thinking. Personally to me, she looks like a caring guardian kind of woman, maybe a mother or loved one. Going back the text says she was 83% happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, and 2%angry. I say it's 100% up to you. In the case of the students what if the picture is taken when they blink? Or if they sneeze? Jane could be having a really sad day and the picture could be taken at the worng moment and say she was ecstatic. You can rely on tech for these readings you need to read them face to face. Ask them how they are feeling, don't just run up and snap a pic. In conclusion, use your words and ask how someone is feeling!","

F153,"Have you ever wondered what venus is like? Well studying venus can be very dangerous with its carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, extremely high temperature and more. Even though it can be dangerous it is a worthy pursuit. Studying venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our sister planet, we are very curious about it, and human can survive venus conditions.

Venus is known as Earths sister planet but we don't know much about it and have never attempted going there. Venus is Earths sister planet because the text talks about how venus is the cloest planet to earth based on size and density. Also Venus has features like vlley, mountains, and craters like earth does and Venus shows that it was most likely covered in oceans long ago and could of supported various life forms. This is why we should explore venus because it is our sister planet

Human curiosity plays a big role into why we should explore Venus. Humans are very curious about the planet since it shows signs that life could of lived there. Also it resembles Earth so much that we want to know more about its geogrpahy. In general we want to know more about this planet and get up close to it and observe it directly instead of from a far. We also want to know what gases there are and so maybe we could build something that wouldn't melt when it lands. This is how human curtiosity plays a role in discovering Venus.

Venus also is a worthy pursuit becuase the text states the temperature is 170 degrees and it states humans can survive on this planet. So even though the temperature and atmosphere seem very dangerous it is worth the exploration because humans can survive so with proper training we could explore Venus. The article also talks about NASA building something to get 30 feet off of Venus so if we can get that close then eventually we will be able to get on the planet.

In conclusion Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it shows many dangers. We can overcome those dangers and make traveling to Venus less dangerous. Since its our sister planet it is worth exploring to find more out about our own planet even. Our human curiosity makes us want to explore Venus in more depth. Also humans can survive on it so with new technology and training they can travel there and be safe. This is why traveling to Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our sister planet, we are curious about it, and humans can already survive on it.       ","

Mona really likes the technology it brings a smile to her face beause how the computer can do imagine a co,eputer knows when your happy or sad. It makes everyone happy in the story how fun and cool techonolgy is it makes them really happy.

Mona states that imagine being able to detect exactly how others people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. (line 1 ) Mona says shes 83% happpy about it,9% disgusted,6% fearful about how the technology works. Mona likes the technology but sometimes it gets to confusing it makes her mad when it doesnt work right for her. in (line 5) vinci computer is kinda similar to monas but moans makes her really mad when it doesnt really work. It all depends on how you update your computers put in sofware into it to keep it going and running fast. (line 1) The software is the latest innovation from prof.

For people not having computers and technology its hard for them to understand it and catch onto is really quick and as old as they are its very impressing they know to work on it. The computer reconginzes the subtle facical movments we humans use to express on how we feel. Experts always know how to work and do the big things with the compurts its hard for people that dont know how to work with them. Humans express on all the techonlogy and how it procseeds. Its always good to have a good working computer that is updated and has the good sofware.                                ","

F155,"No, this new technology is not useful at all because theres no need for a computer telling you how you should feel. How could a machine that doesnt have feeling detect how you are feeling even humans have trouble detecting thatand we have feelings. In a classroom this wouldnt be helpful because its not helping them in school with anything. That is what student want is help in school subjects not their feeling that we ahve friend and family to talk to not som random computer. Most of the time the computer would be wrong because someone could depressed with a happy face on.

In paragraph 1 it says that they tested this on a painting. How could the computer make a 3D model of the face on a picture that it flat. The information that is givin couldn't be accurate at this point. Also she had a strait face in the picture how could she be 83 percent happy if she showed no emotion in the original picture painted. Also, in paragraph 5 in lines 4 and 5 is says that they had to add to the picture so the computer could pick up the face and tell them what she was feeling.

In conclusion this would no be useful at all because its a computer that doesn't have any type of emotions or feeling trying to tell you what you are feeling. Every person has a different face and everyone has different feelings and thats hard for even a computer to understand. Humans have trouble identifying these feeling because no one knows what someone else is feeling except themselves. No computer in the world could tell you what you are feeling. Even if they do have this crazy sofware that they think might work.","

F156,"techonology called the ficial Action coding System enavles computer to identify human emotions is really good thing. we would like to know If they are lying about their emotional. Dr. Huang is really smart but I think he is right.

First,computer to identify human emotions is really good thing because we would know If they are lying to us or no. Acoording the text "" can we actually ""calculate""emotions like math homework"",I think they got the right point because our emotional is like calculate. They have to calculate are we really sad or happy. Another example from the text"" The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". I Hope our school should do like that so people we could help other people whenever we are sad.

Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. Honestly, I used to cheat on my girlfriend too back in the day but the good part is that we don't know facial action yet. If we both know that time I bet she will say"" let do this because I want If you are cheating on me"". Still right now she don't know that I cheat on her but we are already broke tho. I saw on social media a lot Boyfriend and girlfriend did that. When they know they both got cheating,both of them feel wierd. People is really good at hide thing I hope we are did Facial Action so we could know how is lying or nah.

Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing."" The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF

lllinois.""Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say"" I want to meet with Dr. Huang"".

Conclusion,every year different technology is coming out,I can't Imagine what is going be like in 20 year later. What kind of technology would be going out.","

F158,"I wouldnt use this Facial Action Coding System on students because it those enables computers to dentify humans emotions but not real ones, it just shows the human emmotions byt the expression but not the real emotion that the human is feelin, Mona Lisa's natural face might be like that but not because the Facial Action Coding System identified that she has several different emotions showing in that paint from Da Vinci means that she was for real feeling those emotions, I think that is just how her face is , because all the people in this planet have dufferent faces that we cant not even describe if they feeling this or that because there face is just like that, But sometimes its true the Facial Action Coding System might be true because Dr. Huang observed that Da Vinci has studied anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

I t says that the same technology can make computer animated faces more exoressive.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System works perfectly good and does indentify humans expression like Dr. Haung said but not real emotion becasue the person can just be expressing some emotions but that doesn't mean they feeeling it that way.    ","

F159,"I do believe that the use of this technology is and will be extremely valuable.

Some evidence to support why i believe this type of technology could be very valuable is that in the first sentence the article states""She's 83% happy, 9 % desgusted,6% fearful and 2% percent happy. This means that advanced technology can find out all if that information about human emotions and possibly more and it is as easy as calculating homework.This type of technology can also be useful and valuable becasue a situation could be where someone can't express thier emotions, or doesn't know how to express their emotions.That's where FACS come in,(Facial Action Coding System).Also too add to me agreeing that this technology could be very valuable, the Facial Action Coding System was used on Mona Lisa. She never smiles, it's very rare you catch her doing it. So who knows her emotions.

To add to my reasoning the Facial Action Coding System can also be useful is because students in classrooms expressions be so blank, all you can assume is that the students dont wanna be there. But what if there's more to it? What if behind those blank faces is a whole world of emotons,im pretty sure everybody has emotions.Some people love showing them. Some are shy to show them,and others just dont know.But they can know with FACS. It starts with a 3-D computer model of the face that shows the 44 major muscles.FACS has 6 basic emotions,happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

So to conclude my argument i do believe this tye of technology can be very valuble in students classroom because all students has emotion, just some have a hard way of showing them.FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System. It is a new software that has ben developed to shows the basic six emotions of human emotions.Which was modeled on The Mona Lisa.And according to the new software she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful,2% angry. How weird is that someone who rarley smiles is 83% happy. That just proves that this technology could make this world a better place.","

F160,"The technology used in the story is valuable while it reads facial structure, it can evenpin point what exspetion Mona lisa has. They can figure out what she has by the computers information.

First, the calculations that this computer has made is reflecting on her facial features. Paragraph 1 says, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Tis shows how the computer calculates to her facial features depending on muscle in the face. In paragraph 3 it states,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

Second, the desciption of this software take out different inits of emotions by you face structure, In paragraph 4 it states, "" The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements, in a real face or in painting face of Mona lisa. By weighing in different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions"".This shows how the device works and what is exactly calculates.

Finally, the many ways the computer claculates your facial structure depends on how you feel. In paragraph 6 it states,""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". This shows how the demonstration of Mona Lisa makes a person feel happy and how they choose to mrket their product. Pragraph 6 also states,"" The same technology can make compuer animated faces more expressive"". This shows how they could furtther their computer development.

This computer is valuable and helps people figure out how people are feeling. The computer will be a good peice of equipment on the market is it is able to be used by proffessions and teachers.","

When I say that You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules I mean that there would be 335 for all the types of animals. You would also get to have the chance to sail over the seas and have fun because you would be able to sign up with your buddy and travel together. The last reason is that you would be able to have free time to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime.

After reading these reasons that I stated I hope that you consider joing the Seagoing Cowboys. These are the reasons why I think that you should join.

F162,"Yes i think that the technolody to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom is valuble. One reason why i feel like this is a good diea is because it lets you help the student out if they are deprssed or something. Because not alot of students may not say anything because they dont want their business out there in public. And iIf you use this technology then youll be able to come talk to that student 1on1 as a techer face to face to solve the problems they they are delaing

with.

Its basically a 3-D computer model that scans your whole face. And all 44 major muscles in the model must must move the exact same just like human muscles should. It has 6 basic emotions which are happines,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness. So its like a software and you scan your face and it shows your emotions and you are basically having the human traits when

it comes down to

emotions.

Us humans preform the same task when it comes to trying to paint sculptures of peope and paintings.

For example Mona LIsa she was a human that alot of people know about because of the well known Painter Da Vinci ended up making a famous painting of her. Her painting made alot of people smile when they seen her cause it showed different types of emotions when looking at her.

But now people are starting to benfit the future as technology is only going to improve as we live life. For example say that you smile when a web ad appears on your screen because it may be something that you are interrested in. But alos say that what if a different type of ad shows up and then you have a sad or different type of expressin or emotion. Then the screen will go to a different ad because it bascially scaneed your face. And it seen how you reacted so it made up some changes.

But if i was to judge i think this is a good use of technology. aAd i feel like we could use this not only in a psoitve way. But to help benefit the next geneartion of people in the future. ","

F163,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.","

For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.]""

F164,"Do the computers tell people emotions or what they think? why does the mona Lisa smile make people smile? There are three facts bout why the can not tell emotions or expressions.

The first piece of evidence is there are six different type of emotions and the software would not be able to figure them all out. The six types of emotiond are happyiness, sadiness, angry, disgust, fear and suprised(Dr. Paul Eckman). i believe that computers cant tell if the software can tell whether or not if people have the right or any emotion at all.

In the fourth paragraph Dr. Huang states that "" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" (Dr. Huang) ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions""( like not smiling broadly).I agree, each individual has their own exprssion that can happen anytime.

The Mona Lisa makes people smile because of how interesting the expression is on her face and how you dont know how she feels. Mona Lisa could be mad, happy, sad, scared, worried, any of these emotions can express how she feels in the painting.

The auther that wrote this artice is stating that software may or may not understand if you have emotions or any expressions. it can not tell because the software is not alive to tell if you are in a mood or not.","

F165,"I think the computer the students are using to identify human emotions is valuable. It could useful for many things in the world or can use for important uses like if people are lying. This techology could be helpful to scientists for many uses or like in the article says for identify paints or surgeries. In the following paragraghs i will give my reason why its a good reason to the FACS and evidenece.

The reason i agree that they should have the FACS is because it could be used for alot of things like see who is confused or lost, and if someone is lying when they are introuble, and even if they need it for a painting like this artcle. I think people always questioned if mona lisa is happy or mad, or even confused. In the artricle on paragraph 3 it says that the computer can classifi if someone or some painting is happy, sad, anger, fear, and disgusted. So what they did is they made the painting 3-d and scanned her face to see what was her emotions were during da vinci was painting and also it says that the computer can also major 44 muscles on our face and can tell if we are happy or sad. on paragraph 1 the result of what emotion mona lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful andf 2% angry. this result could be right or just what the computer thinks what her emotion was in that very moment da vinci was painting her.

In conclusion i do think FACS is valuable because it could help figuring out emotions on people in paintings like da vinci, help during surgery, help the teacher know if people did understand the lesson or not, and help people know who is lying or not.","

F166,"I am strongly against driverless cars. I feel that whoever came up with the idea must have had some bad food or something. I wonder what encouraged them to even have the thought of a car driving itself. Having driverless cars will most likely end the human population. I am saying this because it makes me think of the movie Wall-e.

In the movie Wall-e there is a robot named Wall-e and earth is deserted or so wall-e thinks. One day Wall-e was doing his normal routine when he stumbled upon a pretty robot named Eve. Wall-e and Eve go on a journey to find her home/ ship, and when they do it is filled with humans. Wall-e is suprised to see the humans he thought they all were dead. Every human that he sees is sitting in a chair that can move them aournd to where ever they want, and get them whatever they want. They don have to get up for anything or physically move their musles. All of the people are obese. People die from obesity, obesity can cause heart problems which can cause a heart attack. Which can make you die. This is only a chair, imagine what it would be like if it was a car.

It would be pointless for adults and teenagers to get lisence. It would be pointless to have rules of the road. Everything that has restriictions, or policies on drivers and their driving would be pointless and useless. As of now we our try to stop drinking and driving. If a car drove itself few crashes but the number lives that are taken will be the same. Peopel can die from alcohol poisoning. Even now cars have malfunctions, what if the driverless car runs into another car because it couldnt stop. A few years ago a lady was on the interstate and her breaks weren't working. The emergency break wasn't even working, and she was going aroung 70 miles per hour. She only had control over the steering wheel. People wont have control over the steering wheel of the driverless car descides to malfunction. Many lives could be taken because of it. This is why i am against driverless cars.   ","

F167,"Normally in everyone's mind when they are a teenager they want to have a car to go to places such as the mall, beach, etc. There are advantages though to limiting car usage. The whole planet should really hear or read about it, it's amazing to what these advantages can do for you, others, and our ecosystem.

The first of many reasons why we should limit car usage is because of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of gas emissions in Europe. . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States(Source 1)."" This just shows the evidence by the future if this keeps going like this the Whole entire planet would be all polluted which would make living conditions harder than they have to be. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way(Source 1)."" Looking at this quote tells me that she must have been stressed with the car, maybe it was because of the traffic or the gas bill who knows, but she does feel happier without it so she must feel more at ease that her area is not cramped up with cars. In Vauban, Germany if you own a car where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner must buy a space, for $40,00, along with a home. Well sign me up with a bike or running shoes because I don't have that kind of money to spend just to live in a area with no cars.

Furthermore I would like to go to Paris, but sources state that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals(Source 2)."" Reuters had found 147 micrograms of particulate matter or PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. That is pretty bad and knowing that people say that you must go to Paris, yeah sure for I can get polluted air into my system got it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since Frtance has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" According to Reuters ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe(Source 2)."" Even Bogata, Columbia has a ""Car-free day"" and if you don't follow the rules of car-free day you will be fined $25. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he and his wife rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife(Source 3).

It is just clear that most areas in the world are trying to change the way we live our lives for the sake of all human life. It is a good oppurtunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution as the source stated before. So the next time you want a car think to yourself ""Which one is much more helpful to the planet's ecosystem?""    ","

F168,"Technology to read emotional expression of students in the classroom is valuable? Is technology in classrom good for students for teacher can read there emotions. I think it would be good to hvae them in classrooms. Teachers should have them so they can read studets emotions. Here are my three reasons why teachers hsould have technology to read emotional expressions.

If the students like the teacher or any other students. If the teacher uses the technology on the students she can tell rather or not if the students likes her. If the students dont like the teacher can at least try to make that student like her. The teacher can tell if the student is going to give the teacher a bdad time by the teacher emotions.

I mean thats good to know because the teacher can know what student going to give her a bad time.

The students are in a bad mood or something or they getting bullied by a classmate. The teacher can know by using that technology on the student. If the student is in a bad mood the teacher can sit down with that students and talk to what student bully him. I think the teacher would find out more which students would catch the bullys. I think that technology would be grate for a school.

I think it could help the teachers know if the students would get that material. Like if they dont get it the teacher can use that technology and know if that student dont get. The teachers would ask that student if the students lie the teacher can use the technology. I think that would be great the teacher can help the student more.

F170,"Exploring Venus is just as important as Exporing the solar system. Venus is Earth twin sister in the terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.

Exploring Venus would help us better understand more about our solar system and even our galaxy. With Venus being just like Earth in terms like density and size it would be fun to explore Venus but also Venus isnt that far from us. But by better understanding Venus would help our space techology improve greatly. With better understanding of Venus will better our konwledge not only of our solar system but our galaxy.

Venus has a thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for us because carbon dioxide is gas element which traps heat that the sun gives to all the planet in our solar system and with Venus atmophere being mostly carbon. Most heat is trap in Venus atmosphere with little escaping with all that heat that is trap it the tempiture on Venus is very hot even for our spacecraft. But despike this exploring VENus is still a good thing because long ago Venus was once a Earth-like planet just like her twin sister Earth.

Despite the challenge that Venus is giving us we will find a way to get past the acid clouds and the thick carbon dioxid atmosphere because through out human history we have had many challenge as a species but we have proven that we are more than comble of over coming this types of challenges.

""[Essay Content: F170 / Exploring Venus is just as important as Exporing the solar system. Venus is Earth twin sister in the terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.

Exploring Venus would help us better understand more about our solar system and even our galaxy. With Venus being just like Earth in terms like density and size it would be fun to explore Venus but also Venus isnt that far from us. But by better understanding Venus would help our space techology improve greatly. With better understanding of Venus will better our konwledge not only of our solar system but our galaxy.

Venus has a thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for us because carbon dioxide is gas element which traps heat that the sun gives to all the planet in our solar system and with Venus atmophere being mostly carbon. Most heat is trap in Venus atmosphere with little escaping with all that heat that is trap it the tempiture on Venus is very hot even for our spacecraft. But despike this exploring VENus is still a good thing because long ago Venus was once a Earth-like planet just like her twin sister Earth.

Despite the challenge that Venus is giving us we will find a way to get past the acid clouds and the thick carbon dioxid atmosphere because through out human history we have had many challenge as a species but we have proven that we are more than comble of over coming this types of challenges. One day we will get to Venus and we will learn about her because human curiosity always win. No matter how challenging it is we will overcome it. By us finlly understanding Venus will as a species will better our understanding not only our solar system but our galaxy as well.]""

F171,"Me being a young teenager and only being in highschool, I feel as if we should keep the Electoral College. Reasons being, if we change too the election by popular vote, citizens are going too choose the president they like, the president that they think will change things, and the president that they think looks best. So of course the citizens are going too choose that particular president just so that president can get the most votes and become president.

Changing too the most popular vote will not be the best idea because, citizens are going too choose the president that they like regardless if the president is good or not so good. If us citizens that are voting like the president, then chances are, we're going too vote for him or her. Not only are we going too vote for him or her, were also going to tell our friends too vote for them also so the president can get the most likes and get elected. With the Electoral College, the votes have to go through a process and then the election goes from there.

Chances being with the most popular election is, we're going too get a not soo good president elected as our president. Most people think that if they choose the ""right"" president, then things are going too change when thats not true. People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say ""well, I only her/him for them because he/she looked as if he/she could change things."" Just because he/she LOOKS like they could change something, doesn't mean its going too happen. That's where the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes in.

I've heard many people say ""I voted for such and such as president because he/she looks best."" In an election for president, looks do not matter what so ever. The president could be handsome or gorgeous and be the worst president in the United States and/or the president could be ugly and be the best president. In a president election, no one is going too care about the looks of the president. We're going too care about the person being voted for president, outlook on things as being the president. A lot comes with being a president and the looks surely aren't one of the things. In my personal opinion, if you're voting for the looks, then maybe you shouldnt be voting at all.

There's many reasons on why we shouldnt change too the most popular vote election and why we should just stay with the Electoral College. The most popular vote election would not be the smartest idea of voting for president and honestly, in my opinion, I feel as if the Electoral College is best. Who would want a president being president because they got the most votes for being liked, voted because their the right president, or voted because they look the best? Truth be told, that's probably the worst thing too change too. With that being said, lets stick too the Electoral College.    ","

This is simply because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have always used this rule in all of our elections for presidents.

I think we should keep the Electoral college this is because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have been going by this rule for all of our past elections and for all of our winning canidates. we have never changed or strayed off from this rule why should we all of the sudden change it? I do not think we should change it because some people disagree with it. You can have your own opinion about it but i do not think just because of someone's opinion we should change what we have been doing for many years before them.

Also i think we should not change this because it has helped us for so long to help elect the president. As in if he or she gets a majority of the votes for that state the they get all the votes for that state. It is a win or take all position. This also allows the people to have a vote and say of who the president should be and who they want it to be.

I understand why alot of people disagree with the Electoral college rule though. This is because the voters who do not get a majority rule do not have a vote in who will be president.

In the article before the author gets to his claim he/she starts off with a questions which states ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable,why are scientists even discussing further visits to its sirface""(paragraph 4).This question give the readers a thought and feeling to what the author is trying to claim.

In this section of this draft theses were the best surpporting deatils to explain information about the authour claim.

In paragraph 5 the author tells readers about NASA

and this paragraph explains that NASA is trying to come up with an soultion to the conditions on surface of Venus and that would allow scientists to float above the fray. This is important because the atomsphere of venus is very strong compared to earth and mars atomsphere and that puts exploraers in danger. Also in paragraph 6 resceachers are trying to make better and improve machines that will surive on Venus. so that resacecher can get rocks, gas for the better knowledge for them to know more about venus.

The last supporting detal is thier is another project reseachers are trying to use to get more information about venus which is to use old technolgoy called "" mechanical computers"" these devices were frist made in the 18000s and played an important role during WW1 in the 1940s, these decives are important to the rescaechers because the computers makes calcualtions by using gears and levers and which doesnt require electronics,This is important because modern techenlogy is too strong today and is much more delicate but the machanical oarts of the old computers can be made more resistant to pressure heat and other forces on venus.

Becuase of the author cliam and deatil. Readers now the importance and struggles rescerachers go through to know more about venus. NASA should continue to study earths sister planet, also find a safer way for researchers to get on earth,for the importantce of everyones kownledge.     ","

F175,"Dear Senator,

We should abolish the electoral college. It nakes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college.

The electoral college is extremely biased on the canditates and the voters have only a miniscule chance to elect the right voter. The chance is so miniscule that even an atom couldn't fit through it. On the counterclaim that it could be a tie, which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? The canditates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, he/she already has 20% of the vote in his/her pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting canditates ""they"" think is best, not voting the canditates their state thinks is best.

To top it off, people are just so wooed by the canditate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a women who needed Obamacare for her ill son, yet she was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam.

A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country? After all these years of black equality and women's rights, we have decided to just completely ruin our entire form of government by being prejuice to other states. Yes, they may have a lesser population, but that doesn't mean anything. It just means that we are not giving people the right of suffrage.

Apparently, the electoral college elects a ""clear winner"", when the popular vote coiuld do that just fine on its own. Why do you think we have voting day for? I'm sure its so that the president that they didn't vote for was chosen by the elctoral college. Here's some logic, lets choose a selected number of people to vote for president instead of all of America. Isn't that a great idea.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their ""something"", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world.

Ladies and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins.                                                            ","

F176,"Facial Action coding is not useful i don't think technology can read someone's emotions because in paragragh 2 it states that ""how can a computer recoginize the subtle facial movements we humans use to ezpress how we feel"" so how can we technology read someone's emotions.

Can the Facial action coding really read how humans feel like how can you read how he/she feel just by looking at them in paragragh 4 it states that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"" if the computur compares your face to another one how do it really know how your feeling how is ti getting the presentages and is it really right about how you feel.

The computer can tell you how you look or how it looks like hoe you feeling but in a picture it probably look like how you feel but how do the computer really know how you feel after or before you took the picture. what if you just did a regular smile but you felt sad would the computer read that you are sad and not happy.

In the Mona LIsa it looks like she is happy in the first paragragh it states that ""she's 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearfuland 2 percent angry"" how do the computer know that she is angry how can a computer read the perfect percent of how you are feeling.

I think that people don't need a computer that can tell them how happy,sad or mad because that's their feelings so how do they know that they are feeling that way.

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F176 / Facial Action coding is not useful i don't think technology can read someone's emotions because in paragragh 2 it states that ""how can a computer recoginize the subtle facial movements we humans use to ezpress how we feel"" so how can we technology read someone's emotions.

Can the Facial action coding really read how humans feel like how can you read how he/she feel just by looking at them in paragragh 4 it states that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"" if the computur compares your face to another one how do it really know how your feeling how is ti getting the presentages and is it really right about how you feel.

The computer can tell you how you look or how it looks like hoe you feeling but in a picture it probably look like how you feel but how do the computer really know how you feel after or before you took the picture. what if you just did a regular smile but you felt sad would the computer read that you are sad and not happy.

In the Mona LIsa it looks like she is happy in the first paragragh it states that ""she's 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearfuland 2 percent angry"" how do the computer know that she is angry how can a computer read the perfect percent of how you are feeling.

I think that people don't need a computer that can tell them how happy,sad or mad because that's their feelings so how do they know that they are feeling that way. In my opion only one person can tell you how happy or sad and mad you are is your self because those are your feelings and some people choose to express their feelings but some don't.]""

F177,"Using technology to read a persons facial emotional expressions is really not a bad idea, just think about a computer being able to tell if your happy,sad,mad ect .In paragraph 1 it states all the emotions that the mona lisa had in the panting when most of the world had thought of her having one emotion,now to think that she acually had almost 5 different things going on in her face in the panting.

""most human communtion is nonverbal including emotional communcaton "" this is really cool becasue people in this time don't do a lot of talking,they most likeing have there face in a screen someone and if Dr. Hang decides to be more open with other companies like apple of samsang that i would be easier to tell what someone means though text or picture,becasue it really hard to decifier what someone truely means mean there not pyhsical there with you. Paragraph 8 says that this computer can tell if your putting on a true or false smile in other words if your telling a lie or not.

In conclusion Dr. hang has a truely great thing going on right now this could be a future in the next couple of years if technology it's any better that in is right now, small things like Dr. hang idea or invention can lead this world bigger and better.  ","

F178,"I think that this new software, the Facial Action Coding System is good idea and a really great system. Because me myself I have friends that will say there fine when I really know there and it and it would be really nice to have this just so your really knew how there are feeling. And I think its super smart that the system uses the 44 major muscles. One thing that I don't like about the system is that someone could use it on me and then someone. Like my mom could and would be able to tell when I'm not ok or when im upset. But I guess if I wanted this to use on my frinds then there is a down fall. And that would be the software could get into my moms hands, But hey you lose some and you win some. Over all I like it and wouldnt mind have it.","

F179,"The thought of a computer program being able to read emotions sounds very interesting at first. It almost makes a person feel like he or she are in a science fiction book set in the future. Though it may be interesting, that does not necessarily make it right. The truth of the matter is that though a computer program measuring how someone feels may be interesting, it is an invasion of privacy and teachers have no need to know a student's emotions while in class. The new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is an invasion of a student's privacy and is not necessary.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because of how invasive it is to a student's privacy. The text explained that the technology was able to determine that in the Mona Lisa painting the person being painted was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy. No one should be able to know to that great of a detail what another person is feeling without that person's premission. If a teacher wanted to know the emotions of his or her students, simply asking them how they feel is enough. Using that technology in a classroom crosses a boundry of privacy that many students would not be comfortable with. Many students would not feel at ease and safe being in the classroom knowing their emotions are being read.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is not necessary. In the text Dr. Huang, who works with the Facial Action Coding System technology, says that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Students and people in general are already communicating their emotions to the level that their emotions need to be communicated. When someone sees another person smiling, he or she knows that person is happy, or if someone sees a person frowning, he or she knows that person is sad. The text says the technology could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored to support that the technology could be beneficial in a classroom setting. But the truth of the matter is, if a teacher wants to know when his or her class is becoming confused or bored, all he or she would have to do is ask. That is why most teachers ask after a lesson, ""Does anyone have any questions?""

Not only that, but a teacher would not have to know if a student is happy or sad in the first place. The responsibility of a teacher is to teach and to ensure the students understand. A teacher does not need to know if his or her students are happy or sad. A school would be wasting its money to pay for a system that is not of necessity.

It is evident with all of the facts stacked against it, that Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in a classroom setting because of its invasiveness to student privacy and the lack of a need for it in a classroom. From the fact that knowing exactly everything students are feeling would make students uncomfortable, to the fact that a teacher could ask a student if he or she wanted to know how that student is feeling, it is clear this technology lacks value in a classroom setting. School administration and the community should ensure that this kind of technology never gets put in any classrooms. This would be a waste of money for the school corporation because of the lack of necessity for it. It would also make many students uncomfortable, which could in turn make it harder to learn.","

With a new technology called Facial Action Coding System it enables computers to identify human emotions. Say youre in a boring class and you cant tell the teacher its boring, with the new technology the teacher will realize her lessons boring and hopefully attempt to change things up. This new technology could also save lives, say theres someone who very sad everyday but wheneverr anyone asks he asks all cheerful because he doesnt want anyone in his business, you could use the Facial Action Coding System to see if hes sad and help him out so he wont attempt anything awful in the future. With the facial Action coding system we can see everyones emotions from the past like wouldnt you like to see what a past president or any past heroes like Martin Luther King Junior's emotions were?

We're technologically advancing so much to where we are able to make items like the Facial Action Coding System. We have come so far, its honestly amazing what we can do with technology, not only is this new technology very helpful but its valuable and fun for anyone to use. This technology could be used as a serious thing or as a fun item.","

F183,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The problem with this is that not all classrooms have computers. This new technology would only get used every time computers are used, so the FACS wouldn't get much use. That is why I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom.

The article states in paragraph one that FACS was developed to help humans and computers communicate. Then, in paragraph five, the article says that humans read each other's facial expressions all the time. I do not think that humans need computers to read each other's emotions if we already do it so well.

Another point to my argument is that the computer may not be able to read people's correct emotions. For example, there is no definite way of knowing Mona Lisa's emotions in her painting. Just because a computer says what her emotions are, doesn't mean that it is right. She may have been happy, she may have been faking; we simply have no way of knowing for sure.

The last point to my argument is using technology to read our emotions. Most teachers don't allow students to use electronics in the classroom. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". To me, a student's learning is more important than them being entertained. Now, being confused is an entirely different thing. If a student is confused they should ask the teacher to explain so that they do understand.

I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom. My biggest issue with this is the tech being faulty. If humans can read each other's emotions without much difficulty, I don't see why computers need to be able to read them as well. I don't see how that benefits anyone.","

F185,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Some include less smog or pollution, stores would be places in walking distance, it saves time because there is less traffic, and it improves safety.

In Vauban, Germany, residents of this upscale comunnity are surburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In Bogota, Columbua, there is a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hikes, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

President Obama proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""    ","

F186,"I belive that the Facial Action Coding system reading is very accurate and can be used in the classoom might help. Theres many ways that if the teacher is aware she/he can might can help out that student. Theres a saying that states ""you cannot read a persons mind"" which is true but you can sense there emotions by the look on their face sometimes . The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson she can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/she is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the she can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can ""modify the lesson "" I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

In conclusion I believe that ther Facail dectection can be very helpful in the classroom setting. It can help teachers learn and create lesson for everybody to get a better understanding in what they are teaching. The analaysis can also help everybody to come more aware and understand facial expression.   ","

F187,"Car usage in different parts of the world are becoming non-existant. In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars in hope of having a more suburban lifestyle. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in this area on the outskirts of Fieburg. Vauban's streets are completly car free. Car ownership however is not forbidden but there are only two places to park in large garages on the edge of the developement. A media trainer and mother of two spoke about her details of this new rule, she stated she is much happier without a car. This will give children around a better enviroment to grow up in because everyone without cars will be outside playing, excercising, and riding bikes. In this new approach to they are making stores in walking distance from your home so you dont even need to use any type of transportation.

Paris also limits driving cars due to bad pollution. People were fined for driving on the roads with a 22-euro fine. These cold nights and warmer days were causing a warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was to blame since France has a tax policy that favors disel over gasoline. Delivery compaines complained about the stopage of veichles and lost revenue, but due to no one driving around the smog cleared the air.

in Bogota, Colombia they expirenced car-free day where everyone walked, hiked, road bikes, or took buses to work. Thsi was the third straight year where cars have been banned and buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars. The goal of this is to reduce smog in the air.

""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating"" says the Mayor of Bogota

F188,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because we can know how that person is feeling at the time. Would you like to know if a person is feeling sad,happy,bored, or even angry? Of course,not only do we know how they feel but we can also take a step futher on helping them. If a person is depressed we can talk to someone close from them and explain what they are going through, or advice them for that person to take therapy.

The Facial Action Coding System is also a great start to poeple who are new to school or even to sports. If a person feels sad because they arent doing as good as their other teamates, The coach should use the software because it will let him/her know why that person isnt really trying in the sport. Another reason why im for it is because teachers really dont know when you are bored or confused. Especially if you are one of those shy prsons that dont like raising their hand. By using this software teachers can go up to you and explain you with what you are having trouble. If a student is bored with what the what teacher is teaching, she should probably try something new to get the students attention. This technology can also show us when someone has a fake smile for example if you think that you have a friend that really isnt your friend and you talk to her she might be giving you a fake smile because she probably doesnt like you.

The use of this software can determine if you are having problems in your house,the expressions that will show would be sadness and probably anger. In todays world you may be going through a lot but people may not know and they would treat you like garbage. This would then cause you depression and probably then commiting suicide. Having this technology ""Facial Action Coding System"" in hands can help you stop somone from danger.

having this technology can ressolve a lot of problems with putting yourself into it. Every perosn has a falling action and a resolution to their story. With just a facial expression it can change realtionships and friendships.""Making people smile"" is what we need with Facial Action Coding System!","

F189,"I believe that we should be using this technology in classrooms around the world. By using this tech it can help teachers modify their lessons to their students needs. This technology could help kids understand the subjects they are working on better because of how the teacher modified it. Teachers could learn how their students truly feel about the subject.

By learning the students emotions it could help the teacher better their lessons. For example, a student could be bored in a class and the teacher can see that so he or she can make it more enjoyable for the class. it could change everyones attitude towards any given subject. This technology could change everyones emotions towards school.

By using this technology it could improve the teachers themselves. By knowing what their students need the teacher could provide for them by modifying their lessons a little bit to be more exciting.This technology could help the teachers improve the students testing scores. This technology could change the futures for these young adults or kids.

The teachers could better understand each and every students emotions towards literally anything. by understanding the students emotions it could help the teacher learn what he or she needs to do for the betterment of the class he or she is teaching. For example,

a student is sad in a class and its affecting his or her grade so now the teacher can find out why the student is sad. This could help the students understand better if the teacher knows how their feeling.

In conclusion, I truly believe that we need this technology in our school systems. By Dr. Huang predicting that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is bored or confused could lead to many discoveries in modern technology. This could help the teachers understand how their students are truly feeling. This is why we need this technology in our schools around the world.      ","

F190,"I believe that this computer would work wonders in a classroom. It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. In the famous, ""Mona Lisa"" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day!

This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health. If a child is slower than other children, this test could help decide whether or whether not these children need the extra help. If they do need help, this machine could even put them in the correct classes!","

This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health. If a child is slower than other children, this test could help decide whether or whether not these children need the extra help. If they do need help, this machine could even put them in the correct classes!]""

F191,"Driverless cars are benifitial for some people. Not all agree on the dvelopments of driverless cars. Now of days, there is not much to expect with new technology. The invention of highly technological cars are high tech and can help with many world problems. Here is an explantion for people that are for the development of these cars.

The driverless cars are very impressive and a good idea if people want better safety on the road. If there was to be any drunk drivers on the road, which should not be driving to begin with, people would want to stay away from that person for the benefits of their own safety. With the driverless cars, the driver that is antoxicated and the other drivers on the road, would all be able to get home safely. The only problem with the driverless car would be driver having to park on their own, as said in the passage. The second example for why driverless cars are great would be a mother driving with her infant. In case of any emergencies, the mother could trust the smart car on steering for one second while she grabbed something for her child. Some people would call it laziness, but it could be very benefitial for a parent.

Understandably, there are reasons why people are against the development for these smart cars. For instance, the smart car mentioned in the passage that BMW made in 2013, that could drive on its own a certain speed. While also only being able to drive when the drivers hands are on the steering wheel. It sounds like a useless product if it is a driverless car. Secondly, why people are against it, is because it sounds like laziness. High tech cars became more popular with sensors in the 1980's as said in the passage. Before, people could walk to their destination and stay healthy. Now there are cars that don't need a driver. Those are some reasons why people are against the development of driverless cars.

In the end, driverless cars can solve many problems in todays world. From drunk driving to helping passagengers, driverless cars can help a lot. Although people who do not want smart cars to develop more, have reasonable reasons why they don't support it, many do support it. It can help a lot with road safety. Concluding that there are good reasons for the development for driverless vehicles.         ","

F192,"Driverless cars seem to be evolving from the looks of it, just reading this article makes me realize how close we are to the future and how close we are to driverless cars. I'm for it just because some people can't drive because their disability and if they just had to sit in the car and tell it where to go that'd be so helpful for them adn everyone eround them. If we're going to do it we might as well just do it already, no arguments for or against it. In the future, we have to make sure they are very safe and trustful. It could lead to a lot of angry people wanting their money back or it could lead to a lot of happy people wishing they had another one. Driverless cars can help a lot of people through things, I know drunk driving is very unsafe and if somebody who is intoxicated were to get in a car, it might aswell drive them itself, because chances are, if that person drives it him or her self they'd be endangering everyone around them. With the driverless cars it'd be way more safe on the roads throughout the night, and even the day. They're too many accidents just in traffic and if the driverless cars were smart enough to be able to sense how to work in traffic it'd be perfect! I can see it now, everyone is safe and cars are just moving along smoothly, not that they don't know but there is always that chance for an accident. Also, people with disabilities who may not be able to drive, they just physically can't, driverless cras would be an amazing idea for the. Now, I know this won't happen for another couple of years or so but it's more than likely that driverless cars would take over everyone's regular cars. That could be a good thing though. For one, like i've already stated it'd make sense for people with disabilities and intoxicated people. For two, it's probably the safest thing i've ever heard of when it comes to cars and driving. Some people still like to drive their own cars, oh well they can still do that, but people who cannot drive at all really deserve to be able to get out of the house and be able to get what they need. Especially, the drunk driving that happens pretty much every day here in America, we need a safer way to be on the streets and I think this is it. Too many people are being killed by drunk drivers and if they just didn't have to drive to get home, if only something could just take them home instead, therefore everyone would be safer, driverless cars could make America so much safer in that aspect. You have to really think about how much safer we would all be if driverless cars continue to evolve and progress. I personally, believe that we'd all be in a safer place, it's hard to even go out at night and not see a drunk driver. That's a very big and important reason why driverless cars would be great for us. Another reason, my mom works third shift hours at a hospital. She drives home in the morning very tired. Imagine if she falls asleep while driving, well it'd make her and I both more comfortable knowing that she wouldn't have to drive herself home when she is that tired. It'd just be so much more safe everywhere and all the time. It's make everyone not worry about whther or not they or their family and friends will be in an accident. It'd make everyone not worry as much about their car being damaged. It'd make everyone safer.","

F193,"I think that we can help people in america by going over sea to help people all over the world. I enjoyed playing table tennis with my friends on board after we had deliverd the animals. We also used to play softball and soccer when we were done. I still remeber the time I saw the Panama canal, the Acropolis in Greece, and the time I took a gondola ride in Venice. If you lived on a farm this is a great oportunity for you. I hope you can join and learn to love it.

I think that you would enjoy it even more if you loved animals. I loved feeding the horses and cows. If you do join heres a tip, learn to love the animals and treat them very kind. Also dont spook the horses they are like big babies. The cows shouldnt be as bad but be careful anyway. I loved spending time with the animals. It was a great experince.","

Giving enough time venus can be inhabitable agian as it once was like our own earth some time ago venus looked like earth.I know this because in the text it says""Venus was probably covered in largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like those on earth.Today,Venus still has some features that are analogus to earth.(Challenge of exploring venus).""This shows how venus was at one point in time inhabitable and can somehow revert back to its old ways according to the text.

Another reason to keep studying venus is that it is completely possible to do so.Why you ask,Because there already is techonology being develpoed to initate study.The technology i speak of is a technology that can withstand the harsh conditions of venus.A great display of this is in the text in paragraph seven when they talk about it.Here it goes,""Nasa is working on other apporches to studying venus.For example,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condidtions"".This shows that nasa is on to something and that there is hope and purpose in studying venus.

The final reason is that this can be the way to human evolution due to us not knowing the future we prepare.What if one day earth is uninhabitable like venus,where would we go?What if we can go to venus and live on there.The thing about evolution and innovation is change and we can prepare for anything.This human evolution thing is backed by nasa themselves in paragraph eight.""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".This shows how we should think of things like this to move forward.

There it is my three reasons why we should furthermore explore venus.That shows how earths twin sister has purpose to be studied,remember venus was once like earth.    ","

F195,I don't think we should use the Facial Action Coding System to read childrens emotions expressions in school because what if the student didn't want the teacher knowing how he or she is feeling for personal reason? If we did that without permission it can lead to privaticy being broken and the students would probably feel uncomfortable. I also think we should use this because the passage says if a student looks bored or confused the Facial Coding can identifiy the problem and it can make the lesson eaiser for the student. The Facial Coding could also be useful because if a student is feeling depressed the machince can identify that and the student can get the help that he or she needs. We don't want students walking around school feeling that way because that can lead to decicions that a student wouldn't usually make if they were happy. Maybe we should get the Facial Coding System in our school systems.,"

F196,"The FACS( Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muslces of someones face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless peice of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to ""decode"" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions she was feeling that very day. She was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class wont change anything in the class room. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be effeciant to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because she would get differnt emotions from many different students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

F197,"I agree that driverless cars are coming. I agree because people are becoming lazy and try to find every short-cut they can. another reason is it makes driving more entertaining. And last a person can still controll the car if he or she wishes. Thats why I believe that driverless car are coming.

The first reason why i believe that driverless cars are coming is because people are getting lazy. People are gitting lazy by instead of walking they use hoverboards. Since people are getting lazy the next step is to have someone drive their car for them. People would buy this type of car so they would not have to put there feet on the pedal all day. Thats how I think people would buy this type of car.

Another reason is that this car would be more entertaining. It would be more entertaining beacause someone who is driving could use their phone because the car would drive it's self. The car could have a tv that someone can watch but when it their turn to drive it turns off. The driiver wouldnt have to be concerned about crashing when looking away because it could drive its self. Thats how this car would be entertaining.

Last the driver could still control the car if he or she wishes. The car notifys the diver when the road area requires human skill.

""[Essay Content: F197 / I agree that driverless cars are coming. I agree because people are becoming lazy and try to find every short-cut they can. another reason is it makes driving more entertaining. And last a person can still controll the car if he or she wishes. Thats why I believe that driverless car are coming.

The first reason why i believe that driverless cars are coming is because people are getting lazy. People are gitting lazy by instead of walking they use hoverboards. Since people are getting lazy the next step is to have someone drive their car for them. People would buy this type of car so they would not have to put there feet on the pedal all day. Thats how I think people would buy this type of car.

Another reason is that this car would be more entertaining. It would be more entertaining beacause someone who is driving could use their phone because the car would drive it's self. The car could have a tv that someone can watch but when it their turn to drive it turns off. The driiver wouldnt have to be concerned about crashing when looking away because it could drive its self. Thats how this car would be entertaining.

Last the driver could still control the car if he or she wishes. The car notifys the diver when the road area requires human skill. This means the driver must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires. The GM has developed driver seats that vibrate when there is danger of backing into an object. Thats how who ever owns the car could still control it if he or she wishes.

F198,"The Electoral College consists of 528 electors. in order for the popular vote tobe valid, an Electoral Colege should continue as is. The Electoral College is a wide range of people who  know what it is thta they want. The Disrrict of Columbia is even considered to be a state just for the Electoral College purpose. The people of America choose their electors in which when they choose their Presidential candidate, they are choosing it's electors. The people of America are practically setting themselves up for whatever outcome comes into play.

Some people claim that people are not voting for the president, but are voting for the slate of electors. These people, however, are simply dramatic and have no sense as to what is actually going on in their country. People do no tvote for a president just because of his or her electors. Presidents are elected because they, as a candidate to be a president, have somehow persuaded the majority of the country to vote for them on their own behalf. A good president is elected because he or she is a good president, not because he or she has good candidates behind them. Yes, with a president comes his or her electors, but the electors are not the ones running for president, therefore they are not the ones persuading the people of America to vote for them, for it is the president that is doing the persuading, and the president that is receiving the votes.

The Electoral College has worked for many many years in the past and if held with respect will continue to work an be a successful way and form of voting. The outcomes will be valid and the responses will be accurate with reasonableactions following it.

The disaster factor is a claim that goes against the Electoral College, however it is not worthy of being a factor. A tie in the Electoral College is not likely, and if it were to happen, it could easily be resolved.    ","

F200,"People say this giant face like montain is from nature, some say its an arifact from an ancient civilization on mars . What do i think? I think it's just mother nature at her best. I will explain to you why i believe so.

And that its not really a face but really its sort of like an illusion ,because of the shadowing at the eyes, nose, and mouth. sure there are huge posiblities that this face can be an artifact ,but we have no proof.

""The Face"" being an ancient artifact.

F201,"The Facial Action Coding System could be useful for panting and people as well. If you look at at painting at someone you really cant tell if they are happy or sad. If you use the Facial Action Coding System it could tell you how they are feeling in the painting and if they are happy or not. You can easliy tell if a person right infront of you is not happy but sometimes you cant. You can use the Facial System on them and it can tell you how they are feeling. Computers can also help out a lot on what you dont understand.

For instance in the Mona Lisa painting you cant tell her emotion in her picture. If you use technology it can help you out and tell you if she is happy or sad. It gives you a percentage like shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It can give you an estimation on how she is feeling in the picture. The computer has an 3-D computer model so it has all of the face major muscles so it can tell your emotion on your face. It can show your surprised if your eyebrows are raised up or if your angry yuour lips would be tightened to show anger. You can also write down different emotions that you do in the mirror and see if someone can reconize what emotion you have. It can tell if you force a smile and if it wasn't a real one. Technology is creating better ways to communicate with humans and developing different things for humans to interact with.

I believe that it would be very different and amazing if they use this on people ands paintings0. It could tell poeple a lot of things they are wondering about people in the world or even paintings that they see. It shows us that technology has plenty of ways to interact with us and give us new things to experince and learn about.","

F204,"My essay on the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is against the development of driverless cars because they are not safe.

Car development has come along greatly, but driverless cars are not the way to go. If someone's driverless car breaks down it will be extremely expensive to replace the parts necessary for function. Driverless cars also would take jobs away from working citizens such as; Cab drivers, Pizza delivery specialists, Postal workers, and Truck drivers. IN THE ARTICLE, it says ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."", but if the vehicle's system malfunctions the commands necessary to announce to the driver to manually operate wouldn't function properly.

Driverless cars can be very dangerous. When one is using a driverless car, he/she is putting his/her and their passenger's lives in hazardous conditions. No one should take that risk. ","

Car development has come along greatly, but driverless cars are not the way to go. If someone's driverless car breaks down it will be extremely expensive to replace the parts necessary for function. Driverless cars also would take jobs away from working citizens such as; Cab drivers, Pizza delivery specialists, Postal workers, and Truck drivers. IN THE ARTICLE, it says ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."", but if the vehicle's system malfunctions the commands necessary to announce to the driver to manually operate wouldn't function properly.

Driverless cars can be very dangerous. When one is using a driverless car, he/she is putting his/her and their passenger's lives in hazardous conditions. No one should take that risk. ]""

F205,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" article infroms the readers about Venus's harsh conditions and mankinds's curiosity to explore this unknown.

This curiosity has challenged The National Aeronaautics and Space Administration (NASA) to strive for a better understanding of Venus.

The author of this article supports this statement well enough, but could have supported his work better.

Throughout the article, the author describes the dangers of Venus explaining why exploration is diffiicult.

In paragraph 3, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" proving that Venus can not support human life or any of human technology.

The author describes the danger well, however, he/she does not address why Venus is a worth pursuit for discovery.

The author repeatedly uses the unknown aspect of Venus's physical attributes and humans' natural curiosity as the two main motives for exploration on this planet.

Paragraph 8 shows this by opening with, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author continuously uses those two factors as to why humans are so keen on pursuing this inhospitable planet.

There is a lack of evidence explaining why Venus is worthy of exploration but informed why we should be exploring Venus but the author describes the dangers of Venus very well.

To strengthen the author's suggestion, studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents, he/she should have included details on what the planet can offer humans or given more reasons as to why humans are so motivated to explore our sister planet.

The author only supports the dangers of Venus presents well in his/her suggestion but doesn't support why Venus is a worthy pursuit in exploration well.","

F206,"This new technology to allow us to read students emotional expressions is brilliant. Reasons being is it allows students to show their true emotion regardless if they act happy, or sad. This will more likely have less kids hide their emotion and can truly be worked on. It can be the difference between life or death. To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa. Using this advance system most people will say she is just happy and smiling, 'but she's actually 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry'. Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted. This will be the future to help towards others and will soon help for the greater good.","

F207,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Lisa smile never smiles she was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful adn 2 percent angry. Well to to me she was most likely angry if she never smiled when using technology you need to make it have a tester that will know everything before making it I feel like they should make a robot but before putting it out have a tester. I see the author asked can we caculate emotions like math well when doing math you have to learn anf figure out well to find out how someone is feeling you have do all of that to get the answer.

The author also asked how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movmetns well by making a robot that is like a human but very 100 percent truth- 3-D.The author says the facial expressions of reach emotion are universal, well you wouldnt know that unless you make a robot and find out if it would work there shoukd be a tester before puting it our.

I see the author has said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday but we human all are not the same it says we can probably tell how a friend is doing by how they face look well I walk around with a serious face people think im mad but im not see when you talk about doing all of this wanting to making things make sure you know what you talking about and that everything is working perfect.

If the technology gets made hopefully Lisa smile is 100 pecent happy. Teachers would need this just in case a student is mad and the teacher gets yelled at they would know like dang ok she or he is mad. So I think the technology should get made but before putting it out make sure it is working and that it tells the truth on how people is feeling and their emotions.","

F208,"I think that the use of the technolohy should not be used because then parent would be complaining how it is not fair for a teacher or students to know her sons/daughters expression. Also I personally think that we shouldn't allow them because then teachers would always be focused on the kids that aren't as happy and are confused on the work or lesson they are learning. I also think that it would also be a good idea for the whole school because if a student is to shy to speak up and they dont know how to do something then the teacher can talk to him/her after class. I think that using this technology will be to much too and the school will have to use millions of dollars just to buy some for a whole class. I know this becuase the author says ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode mocode Mona Lisa's smile. Then they show us how we can do it at home and how we can make use smile or happy. In the artical is states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. (""Putting on a happy face"" actually works"" So at the end of the day I personally don't think we schools should have this type of technogoly and be more focused on other technologys like finger print sign in or school resources.","

F209,"Luke said he grew up on an farm with his aunt so he wanted to help the animals. After World War 2 Luke wanted to help the countries recover by bringing food supplies and animals. Luke loved animals because when he was younger he had lived on a farm. So when he heard UNRRA is hirring Seagoing Cowboys to take care of Horses,Cows,and Mules he and his friend Don signed up. This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""he says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or girl. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people. Then again you should always help people. Luke went would you?                 ","

F210,"""Mom im going to go outside to get some fresh air"" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean.

Its polluted.

But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a mother of two . She walks verdant streets & love listening to her surrounding.

But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on.

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.     ","

F212,"Throughout the years, in fact between the years 2002-2014, numerous newspapers and reporters have reported that having the lack of cars can actually benefit the earth and its population. Also, they say, there are advantages to them. but what exactly are these advantages that could prosper so many car loving fans? Well, there are actually 2 advantages of people would love to have:1, People are much happier and 2, the stress that afflicts many today are gone and also parks are blooming throughout one city because of the lack of the automobiles. So let's consider these wonderful advantages of not having any car.

First, People are much happier without cars than they are with cars.  According to the New York times, one mother who is a media trainer and the mother of two reports as to saying: ""I'm much happier this way."" Her Name is Heidrun Walter and she lives in an area of Germany called Vauban. Vauban is a city where 'street parking,driveways and home garages are generally forbidden.' If to enjoy this kind of happiness in a world full of grim people, who wouldn't want to take up not driving a car?

Second, The stress that people have today are gone and at one city parks are blooming. According to the news reporter Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle times, he writes these words spoken by one businessman in Bogota, Colombia: ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress."" Mr. Selsky also writes this about the parks blooming throughout the city of Bogota:""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city.""

""[Essay Content: F212 / Throughout the years, in fact between the years 2002-2014, numerous newspapers and reporters have reported that having the lack of cars can actually benefit the earth and its population. Also, they say, there are advantages to them. but what exactly are these advantages that could prosper so many car loving fans? Well, there are actually 2 advantages of people would love to have:1, People are much happier and 2, the stress that afflicts many today are gone and also parks are blooming throughout one city because of the lack of the automobiles. So let's consider these wonderful advantages of not having any car.

First, People are much happier without cars than they are with cars.  According to the New York times, one mother who is a media trainer and the mother of two reports as to saying: ""I'm much happier this way."" Her Name is Heidrun Walter and she lives in an area of Germany called Vauban. Vauban is a city where 'street parking,driveways and home garages are generally forbidden.' If to enjoy this kind of happiness in a world full of grim people, who wouldn't want to take up not driving a car?

Second, The stress that people have today are gone and at one city parks are blooming. According to the news reporter Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle times, he writes these words spoken by one businessman in Bogota, Colombia: ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress."" Mr. Selsky also writes this about the parks blooming throughout the city of Bogota:""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city."" The Advantages of not driving a car are pretty great.

In conclusion, the advantages of not having a car to drive are very numerous. another reason for not having to drive a car is that of pollution. and the list could go on. So as has been shown, People are happier and stress-free without having to drive cars. So may you ever be happier if you don't have to drive cars.    ]""

F213,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is a waste of time. I think it's a waste of time because studies show that you can be able to tell when someone is down. Not by the face but by their actions. You will start to see a change in them, they wont act the same even if they try so hard to,ect. The Facial Action Coding System is a waste of money, time, and space.

Why do all this just to see if someone is hiding their emotions, when you can just observe them. A true friend, mother, father ect; will know if something is wrong with their loved ones. In the article the very first sentence says "" she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Why does it matter how fearful,disgusted,or angry she is if it clearly states she happy 83 percent. We are not computers, robots or none of that we are human beings and we all have different emotions running at the same time. Thats what makes us, us!

In the article it also states "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" My point here is that you dont observe a persons feelings by looking at their face. You observe the way they act and compare it to how they usually act when mad, sad, or happy, ect. People sometimes hide their emotions by putting on a fake smile, hiding their true emotions thats why you observe actions.

I just feel as if its easy to tell the difference between different emotions. It's common sense to me, but it may not be to you. When you really think about it, they make it seem like its really complicated. But if you would just pay close attention to your loved ones, and stop thinking that everyone has to always be happy. Then you will see that its easy to tell the difference of each emotion we humans have.

This is why i think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Hopefully you will understand where i'm coming from. The Facial Action Coding System is unnessacary, and a waste of time. It's easy to tell when someone is acting strange or different. All you have to do is observe.   ","

F215,"The Mona Lisa is a very iconic painting by Leonardo Da Vinci; however, no one pays attention to how her smile was constructed. According to the new computer software, Facial Action Coding System or FACS, she's 83 percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. This software is very useful and can help push technology ahead.

The process begins with a computer constructing a 3-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles must move like a human face. These movements are called action units. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and implied them to facial muscles. The software can even track mixed emotions. For example, the Mona Lisa as she has four different emotions in her picture.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to people's faces., while it shows just how much a computer can do. Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". He continues to go on about how it could modify a lesson like a human instructor. This can be very useful for children and teenagers who are homeschooled and take online courses. The same technology can make computer-animated faced more expressive for video games or surgery.

This FACS machine isnt very necessary for daily life, but can help in the classroom. It is very cool and interesting, and can help teachers know when students are struggling. This software is going to help humans in the future and will only become more advanced. Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". He is correct with that statement.

In conclusion, Dr. Huang and his colleague did a terrific job in creating such an advanced piece of technology. This will help teachers and schools in the future. The only problem is the cost of the item, because it will most likely be pretty expensive. Making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.","

F216,"Does the Electoral College Work?

Mr. Senator,

I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. Elector  groups are picked by the runner; the groups help raise votes for the runners to get more word out on what the runner has to offer for our country. Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and women, who are wanting to represent our country. Furthermore, the state elector running for president, is assisted by our votes, because when you vote for your candidates, you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.       ","

F218,"Most people either own a car themselves or know someone who owns one either way most people own a car. The fact is though that the advantages of limiting car usages adds up to about a billion but today im here to present just a couple to you.

As Ms. Walter says in the article ""'I'm much happier this way'"" (3) and see she owned a car and she always felt tense but now without a car she can hear the sound of bicycles and ""'...chatter of wandering children'""(3). Many people just like her either own cars because they don't know how to live without them or they don't own cars and they are less tense and can hear the wonderful sounds of mother nature. Just think about it; how often do you hear birds chirpping or kids playing at parks or even leaves rustling? if you were honest you would say almost never because its true all of the motorized vehicles that we have in this world drown all of the best sounds out. We simply don't hear them anymore; no instead we hear a train running by at tweleve in the morning or the screech of tires at six in the morning on the way to school or even worse we hear tons and tons of car horns going off all at once just because someone isn't moving at a red light. Seriously do we even know how horrible all of that is and guess what its all because the human population wants to be able to get places faster.

Most people are noticing this now but in the past no on noticed that our own way of trassportation was and is polluting the world. In Europe 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emmisions are caused by passenger cars. Also ""...up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(5) are greenhouse polluted because of the cars. The human race can stop this ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway""(6). See thats the thing we can change this and we can survive with out cars. There is no disadvantage of limiting car use because we can live without them. Infact there are only advantages; we can stop polluting the earth, we can have a safer world, and we can finally hear mother nature and concentrate on something better in our lives. The thing is that we dont even have to go without cars because we have created electrical cars that are rechargable; yes they are very expensive but if we just used those then they would be alot cheaper. By having a car we are polluting the earth and by not having one we aren't; not polluting the earth is a advantage of limiting car usage.

The fact is that the advantages of limiting car usage out weigh the disadvantages of limiting car usage which is why having a car can help or hinder us; just depends on you look at it.    ","

F219,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling.

Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe she was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what she really felt in the painting.

So in conlcusion I do agree and am for the Facial Coding Symstem all the way. It makes the paintings and pictures look nice, and have more emotion. So im all for it.","

""[Essay Content: F219 / In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today.

F220,"The old question has finally been answered, ""Was Mona Lisa happy or was she just trying to trick her audience to think that she was."" Now, thanks to technology, we are able to figure out how she actually felt. With hard work and coding computers will be able to tell how people are genuinely feeling. This technology will help in schools, working environments and more, people will be able to tell if someone is feeling upset, depressed, happy, bored or content.

In relation to Mona Lisa, the article explains that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that the computer is advanced enough to identify emotions of a woman from many centries ago. Due to the study of human anatomy the computer is able classify emotions like ""happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" With normal identification skills if there was a mix of them people could tell exactly how others felt. For instance if someone got 68% sadness, 22% angry and 10% fear, then people could tell that the person needed help, or was not fine like they said they were. If computers with this technology were in schools teachers would be able to tell if there student were okay. Most students say there okay but with this technology we would be able to perceive if people need help or theorpy. It could change the world by helping prevent less suidcides and self harm or peer pressure and bad decisions. Although it seems this technology could only be in sci-fi movies, the article explains that ""It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" Even so, with human persection we can not read or figure out everything from people by what they say and how they look but with the extra help from technology we can get even closer. Nick D'Alto confirms that ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Yes people have study this for a long time but the computer is just as capable without as much time. The computer reads peoples faces by creating a model and comparing it to the same persons face with no emotion and uses knowledge of the face muscles to determine one's emotions.

However, this technology could also do simple things within a class room like tell if a student is confused or bored or tired. In addition to this information from students schools can find what makes students want to get their education and can get them to enjoy and understand it at the same time. Nick D'Alto claims that ""Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Accordingly, with teachers and technology working together it could improve schools for students and teachers.

With this technology it could help overall morality and acedimics within classes. It could also help human communication, and get people and computers to work together more than before.     ","

F221,"Dear state senator,

I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when ever the person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs the other person who is not well known. Also if they do go to election school they could learn how to run for pesident and learn how to write speeches, and also teach them that some of the 50 states in the united states have to have his/her vote.

The out come of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then the outcome for next year will maybe bet higher or lower. When ever a US citizen votes they are also voting for the electors canidates. and when you do vote that person who is running for president that helps his/her's group get elected. Every president has to have a Vice president.    ","

F222,"The advantages of limiting car use are you become less stressed, you have cleaner air, and decreases the amount of traffic jams.

She is happier because she does not have a car. in the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" it also says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution...""

Secondly, limiting car use helps the air be cleaner. For instance, in the passage ""paris bans dring due to smog"" by Robert Duffer it says,""after days of near-recod pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars pollute our air so putting bans on cars will freshen our air.

Thirdly, limitation on the use of cars will decrease the amount of traffic jams. for example, in the article ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it states that, ""...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trffic jams."" with out so many cars being on the road other forms of transportation jush as buses or trams have room them to drive and be on time.

F223,"We have all seen the look on Leonardo da Vinci's very own Mona Lisa's face. Some might see a blank face. Some may see happiness, anger or even fear. A machine by the name of Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) can tell you exactly how she feels. This new technology can even be valuable in the classroom.

This recently created software scans facial movements. It weighs the different units of expression. Although Mona Lisa is just a painting that doesn't move, she is compared to a neutral face. According to Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, researchers of FACS, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

It may seem unlikely that Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, only uses ""six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness"", but when the computer constructs a 3-D model, it uses all 44 major muscles in the face.

Imagine making a certain facial expression and your computer screen magically changes its settings. In the future Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could cause a dramatic postive change in test scores. Also not all students can gather information the same way. Students will want to know more if the information is grabbing their attention.

Allowing computers to scan information from facial expressions in the classroom setting can and will drive students to want to learn because of the personal format and reliablity.","

F224,"In my opinion I think it will be a good idea for the teachers to know if a student is in a good mood or not. When a teacher calls on a student and dont not want to go the teacher might think it is because that child is being rude, and all that the child want is to be left alone.

With the scaning programs, that could scan your face and can tell if you are in a good mood or not, teachers and student could have a good bond. If the teacher scans a kid face in morning when they all enter class she could know who to call on ,or maybe even after class she could even have a talk with the child. If someone can tell how a person feel if it's fear , anger ,digust, happiness,and surprise.

F225,"Are you a person that loves helping other people, going on adventures, and having fun? If you are you should join the Seagoing Cowboys/ Girls. I will be talking about reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys/Girls and also details from Lukes claim.

The reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys/Girls are you get to help other people, you get to take care of animals, and last but not least you get to have fun. Helping other people is awesome because then they look up to you. Caring for other animals is kind as well because then they will start to trust you and other animals will do the same. Yes it can be a lot of work becase you have to keep them clean, make sure they have food and water, and you have to make sure there enviroment is clean, but its worth it. Again last but not least you get to have fun! Who in the world does not like to have fun?

On board you get to do games like table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, baseball, and volleyball.

Luke claim is it is an apportunity of a lifetime and it's an adventure, you get to freetime and do cool things, and it will open the world to you. Before Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy he worked two part-time jobs he worked in a grocery store and a bank. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe in a cattle boat. Luke thought this was a chance of a lifetime and he couldn't pass it up so he went. When Luke was on his way to China Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. Now thats an adeventure and it shows how he had free time to do that. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger as he says. He says it opened the world for him. It allowed him to get a bigger picture of the world, and see what it was like. He says he is grateful for the apportunity and if you get an apportunity like that you should be glad to.

In conculsion this sounds like a lot of fun to me . All thought it is hard work and you have to be dedicated to it. In the long run though it would be worth it, because you get to help so many people. If you like going on adventures, helping other people, and having fun.

F226,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is suggesting that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, and I think that she does a very good job backing herself up. In this article she gives the things that are wrong with going to Venus but she also gives the things that are good and reasons why you should make a trip to Venus. The author of the story stays with the way she feels throughout the whole article making a strong and valid point. With the author not just telling you all the good things about going up to Venus is making her statement even more valuable. Becuase she is telling you upfront that their are some altercations and disadvantages of going but their are many ways that you can compromize and make it more safe for you to travel and be by Venus.

In the article the author states ""Astonomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" ""...Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" ""...mincludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These four quotes from the story are evidence that the auother put saying that Venus has features that are like Earth. Some other quotes from the story that are crutial in helping the auother prove that Venus is a good planet to explore despite the dangers is ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray.

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F226 / In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is suggesting that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, and I think that she does a very good job backing herself up. In this article she gives the things that are wrong with going to Venus but she also gives the things that are good and reasons why you should make a trip to Venus. The author of the story stays with the way she feels throughout the whole article making a strong and valid point. With the author not just telling you all the good things about going up to Venus is making her statement even more valuable. Becuase she is telling you upfront that their are some altercations and disadvantages of going but their are many ways that you can compromize and make it more safe for you to travel and be by Venus.

In the article the author states ""Astonomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" ""...Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" ""...mincludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These four quotes from the story are evidence that the auother put saying that Venus has features that are like Earth. Some other quotes from the story that are crutial in helping the auother prove that Venus is a good planet to explore despite the dangers is ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" These two quotes are telling us that if you were to go to Venus you wouldnt have to step foot on the panet you could stay in a vehicle and take pictures.

F227,"The technolology to scan your face and tell your emotions is kind of creepy. Having a machine in class to tell teachers how the students are feelling is just a little weird to me but it also could be very usefull. In the text it states that the software in the computer could see if you are confused and will change the lesson so the student will better understand.

The main reason why this is creepy to me is it reminds me of the Movie Tremator. In the movie Arnald Swartsnager comes back to the past to protect the future leader of the human rebelian aginst the superior robots they have built. Well to make a long story short the robot that Arnald Swartsnager plays can scan Robert Oconner's face and asked him why is your face leaking. Yes I know this technology is far more advanced than the movie ,but that is how I can relate.

I can also relate to how the computer could tell if you are confused and change the lesson so you can learn the way you do. In the text it states the computer can tell if you have a fake or forced smile or a guinine smile by the rincles under your eyes. The text also said you can probly tell what mood your friend is by the look on their face,but the person could be hiding their true emotions from you so the computer can tell if you are mad at that person at that time and place.

In the story the author includes how most video games and surgery cames have non verbal comunications,and how your home computer could never process this information like how your feeling that day.

I personaly would like to have this technology in our classrooms,and our homes. This would help out alot of men. For an example its your one year weading anaversery and you ask your lovley wife what she wants to eat. A simple question,but you rember that she can never tell you where she wants to eat. Or the example your kids come home acting odd you ask what is wrong but you dont get a responce. So you go in to there school computer and watch what mood he or she is in.

So I have told you my thoughts on the subject time to recap. I first thought it was odd and kinda scarry due to it reminding me of a movie and the robots. Then we relised that this technology can be great for the students who dont fo very well in school becaouse they do not get the lesson.","

Then it put on viens or thing that make u laught into u cry or it put on some cat that are funny. I think it is a good thing then all you will have to do is say to your computers how do i feel today it will say to you like It say in fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day.

F230,"Vauban, Germany, the motorless city. Vauban is an upscale community, yet they have one difference than any other, they have given up cars. When you visit this motorless city, you don't see driveways, garages or any other home accessory that invloves parking, or storing your car. When you think of a city like this, you think that there is no way a town can survive without automobile transportation, well, you thought wrong. Unlike most towns, Vauban has located all the necessary stores and shops on a main street, where it is easily found and just a walk away.

Vauban is also a happier place, as suggested by Heidrun Walter, mother of two and media trainer. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" When she walks the street she sees young children playing and chatting and people riding their bicycles, but best of all, she doesn't hear that awful noise of a running motor.

Automobiles are a detriment to the ecosystem. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gass emissions from tailpipes..."" Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. And, up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Back to Vauban, the home of 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This town may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban lifestyle. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. This group promotes new communities that are less dependent on cars.

In the United States, ""car-reduced"" communities are being promotedby thr Enviornmental Protection Agency, and legislators are beginning to act, if cautiously. ""Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new 6-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year,"" Mr. Goldberg has said.    ","

F231,"Venus is a very powerful and beautifully dangerous planet, why wouldn't we want to explore her unknown? The author of ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes this question is a worthy one and believes it is worth the dangers.

The author supports his idea well and allows for the readers to understand how important it is. Venus is a worthy pursuit for the author and has given many details on how it can be achieved.

The author states that the surface of Venus is very close to what earth is now and was once the same as earth. Stated in paragraph 4,""

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Scientists at NASA are working to get close and personal with Venus and allowing the risks to be conquered. Paragraph 7 illustrates,""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The other project that will allow scientists to still have working things in the conditions of Venus is a mechanical computer. These computers need no electronics and use gears and levers to work. They are sturdier and more durable. As said in Paragraph 7,""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions.""

The author firmly believes that the temperatures of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth does not inhibit him from wanting to pursue it further.

The author illustrates how the dangers and problems scientists are facing do not out weigh the curiousity of the minds of the human race. He supports the idea with powerful and strong details. With all of our curiousity focused on our strange and beautiful neighbor Venus, why would we ever stop trying to learn more about her? The beautiful mystery that is Venus is a wonder to all that wish to know. She isn't called the ""Evening Star"" for nothing, she shines and is pursued.","

F232,"Cars can have a really bad effect on society. It can cause stress, car accidents, and money issues. Limiting cars has alot of advantages, it's a stress reliever, no car accients or worrying about how your gonna have to pay your car insurance.

In Vauban, Germany residents are living without cars. One women Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, explains how she is much happier without her car.  57 percent of people have moved to the community when they heard about the community. It is said to be called smart planning. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S.. You don't have to worry about how your going to make it to your favorite store or market without a car because stores are places a walk away, on main street. The Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting car educed communities and legislators are starting to act.

Paris enforced a limiting driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days. France enacted a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

Bogota, Colombia created a program called the car-free day. Powerful people from other countries camre to Bogota to see the mindblowing event. Parks and sports center have been createdbecause of this event.

In the U.S. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting feweer licenses as each year goes by. Rates of car ownership per household and per person strted to come down two to three years befpre the downturn. Teens are starting to organize their life around when they can walk, take public transportation or car-pool.

F233,"The author of ""The challenge of exploring space"" does a excellent job supporting the arugument that Venus should be further explored. They did this by using research done by NASA, scientific projects, and even presenting challenge to the reader or audience.

In pararaph 5 the author intoroduces an idea that NASA has made special products to explore the face of Venus. The author says "" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiing venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a high altitude to fly over many storms, a vehice hovering over venus woud avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This evidence helps convey the idea that the face of venus shoud further be explored because space experts have been working on it.

Similarly, in paragaph 7 the author intorduces a new idea that NASA has also been working on. Electronics that can survive the harsh enviornment of Venus. The author states ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This is another piece of evidence the author used well to support their agument that Venus shoud be further explored because we have the ability.

Lastly the author proves her argument rigt because he/she presents a challange at the end of the article that makes you want to take action. The author says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginaton and innvoation."" This is the last sentence of the article and the writer did a very nice job using it as a challenge to face and a call-to-action. This sentence will make reasearchers accept the challenge, which will prover her argument correct.

Overall, the author did an excellent job of presenting the argument and being able to support it with different types of evidence and even a challenge. The method he/she used was very effetive and proved a point very well.      ","

F234,"The idea of a driverless car has been an idea only meant for science fiction films. The concept of the whole idea seemed as though people would not see in their life time. Until now, engineers and scientists are closing in on the idea that self driving cars are a thing of today. Top car manufacturers are now developing ideas and ways to bring us closer of this once fascinating dream, into a reality. To wake up some day and simply send a text or call a local business to send a driverless car to give them a ride to where ever they need to go. Also, the amount of time saved for people not having to car for their cars and take them to body shops and pay high prices for problems in the engine.

But before the idea can pick up even more on its popularity; some people may ask what would its use be?

There many young adults and teenagers who still have not received their drivers liscense and have to wait on a parent or guardian to come pick them up from school, activity, or sporting event. With the self driving car, those people may some day just call or text a business operating the cars to come and pick them up and drive them home. This method would relieve the stress of the parents having to drive there and wait on their loved ones. This method may also be used to replace the tradtional taxi driving system. The traditional taxi system was said to be unsafe under certain situations. for example the taxi driver can manipulate the customer if the customer is unaware of the streets and driver can then take the longest route to charge a substainally high price for a drive that was not suppose to take as long. With the driverless car, the car will not manipulate the customer and reach its destination at an efficient time and price. Along with the amount of fuel saved from the driverless car, our economy may no longer rely on fossil fuel as a sufficient source of energy for our cars.

Another reason why the driverless car idea might be successful is the lives it could save for the drivers who are not paying attention. some cars may not be driverless but the ones who can break before the driver can react is amazing. A popular car with the system that the car can break before you can react is Subaru. Subaru has always been popular with its safety features, but now, with the newest models, the car is now capable of stopping itself before an accident can occur. How this works is that this car isn't necessarily driverless, it is still a driver needed car. But what makes this car stand out in safety is its sensors in the front and the back of the car. it is used to detect any situations or actions of other drivers that can start an accident. In one scenerio, a lady is backing up her car from her driveway and is distracted by her child in the back, not realizing she was still backing up the car's sensors detected an oncoming vehicle and immediatly stopping the car. The car saved the lady and her child from injury and the lady will notdeal with insurance for damages and costs of repairs. This is just one of the dozens of scenarios that can happen when a driver is not paying attention and could lead to serious accidents. With smart technology we can save the lives of millions of drivers whose accidents could have been prevented.

in conclusion, the idea of driverless cars is still a thing to be worked on and in need of improvement. But we are not far from seeing cars without drivers driving safer and more efficiently than human drivers. Not to mention the growth the economy will have from people switching from buses and uncomfortable rides with strangers. driverless car will not harm other drivers or harm how we see cars, instead we will see them as a safe, efficient, and well protected vehicle for transportation. Even if we do not succeed in having driverless car, we still have had many advancements from keeping drivers safe and preventing accidents that could be saved. ","

The article also says that Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, was always tense when she was behind the wheel and so she gladly gave up her vehicle and now lives a very happy life in Vauban.

In Paris they banned driving due to the increase of smog, they planned which days the people could drive on. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it states ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" At first many people refused and were fined 22-euro ($31) but the people who didn't helped lighten up the smog.

In Bogota, Colombia, the people have a car free day where they walk or ride their bikes to the places they need to go but there are still buses and cabes that the people can take. If the people were to take their own car they would be fined $25.  In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it states ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" The article also says that millions of colomibians have biked, hiked, skated, and rode on buses to work.

In America the people are driving less, buying fewer cars and getting fewer license. The article ""The end of the csr culture"" states ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.""

F237,"If we think about it, this software is actually a big help for the schools and such. If we see our friend is in a bad mood then we can talk to them or find out why. I think this system can actually really help us but not only us but our teachers as well. The system digs deep into our muscles and will understand our whole face. It will indicate actions, emotions and feelings so that could help our friends if they are wondering why we are in a happy mood or a bad mood.

Our friends are really helpful at times so if our friend is feeling down or is happy about something we should have the right to know. According to Dr. Huang the software can tell us many things about a persons mood or what they are really feeling like. Knowing if a person is down or happy we can talk to them and ask what is going on, why are you sad or why are you so happy. By the computer telling us how a person is feeling will be so valubale because it shows us how big our technology is getting and by us knowing that we know there is going to something bigger than that later on in the future so now all we would do is wait for something bigger.

This software would be very helpful fot our own teachers because they could take us to the computer get our face to the computer and indicate if we aare bored or not. If she does this while she is teaching lesson and finds out we are confused then she can change her ways in teaching that lesson so we can actually understand it and if the teacher knows we are in a happy mood then she knows we understand the material or atleast thats why we are happy.

The Facial Acting Coding System would be a really good thing for us so we ned to get it attachted to our school software. All together it would help our friends and teachers. Espically the teachers because they would know what to do to teach us better so would understand the material that they want us to learn and the system would be a genuine thing. Not only would this help with teaching and understanding but for our friends that have depression, we would know when there emotions are hurting or when they are in a hurting place and we could help them by this software being a thing. People with depression never show it and we understand that but we could atleast do something about that and that is helping them and being there for them.","

F238,"The posibilty of a face reconizing computer would be very helpful for children or even adults. Its would be helpful in a ways of satifying our needs and why showing us thing that would make going on the internet better.

I think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says "" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"". And if the students is ""confused and bored"" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.

In my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what her/she is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.","

I think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says "" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"". And if the students is ""confused and bored"" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.

In my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what her/she is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.]""

F239,"There are many ways of limiting car usage. Some advantages of limiting usage are people are much happier and safier, you dont have to hear the aggravating sounds of motors and tires screeching by, and air pollution is decreased majorly.

In the first passage, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two children stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By this she means she doesn't have to worry about her or her families safety as much, being on the road is a lot more dangerous than walking. Driving you can never tell when there's going to be an accident, everything just happens so fast. There is nothing you can do to prevent car wrecks from happening. You may do everyting in your power to be a safe driver but there will always be other people on the road not paying attention and cause a crash that you can't prevent. Walking where you need to go is the safest way to get around. You don't have to worry about car crashes or worrying over your families safety.

Another example of the advantages of limting car usage in passage one is, not hearing the screeching sound of car motors or tires flying by. Instead of hearing the familiar sounds of cars passing by you hear the joyful sound of children wandering around or riding their bicycles. People find it more calming to hear the sound of a child enjoying themselves instead of hearing the roaring and deafing sound of vehicles going by. When people are at home trying to relax they do not want to hear loud noises through their neighborhood. That's suppose to be their winding down time to escape from everything. Without vehicles people would be a lot more calmer, and relaxed.

The last example came from the second passage. It states that there is a major decrease in air pollution in Paris as they enoforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. One day they ordered people with even-number license plates to leave their cars parked or suffer having to pay a fine. In the text it states that, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" With this being done congestion was down sixty percent in the capitol of France. By them taking control they reduced the amount of air pollution in Paris.

By limiting the usage of vehicles we make people a lot happier and safeir, you don't hear the annoying sounds of cars screeching by, and last but not least air pollution is decreased in a huge amount.            ","

F240,"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are  acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.  acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.  it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/her house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.    ","

F241,"Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,""he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. In 1945 world war 2 made places get ruined so he decied to go to Seagoing Cowboys. He help animals like horses,young cows,and mules too. He had so much to do but he did it and yes it was hard but he did what he was suppossed to do. A Seagoing Cow boy was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world up to him. He is gratefull of the opportunity.           ","

F242,"The electoral college doesn't work for everyone its not fair. There are people who want a good president to run the conutry, not just some guy that the electors pick. Electorl College is not a good way to pick a president the people are not picking them isnt that want it suppost to be people pick the president not electors. In the text the author write that the electorl college doesnt let the people that have the most vote win because your picking a elector and the elector is picking the president even though he/she has the most vote its not fair. We the people should be the ones picking the president, we are the one who want him/her to run the coutry because we think he/she can do it.  The electoral college should be abolishied and people should pick the president.

There are state in our conurty that are smaller then other states. Those small states dont get a say in the voting for the president because the bigger states rule over because of the electorl college rule. The author says ""larger states like Flordia has 29 electorl vote and Wyoming only has 3 electorl votes."" So that means that the larger states get more attention form the president then the smaller states do. That's not fair the smaller states should be treated like the bigger states not left out. The electrol college (electors)is the one picking the president not the peoplein the small or large states.

F243,"From the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" The Authir talks about how there is new technology that is call Facial Action Coding System or FACS for short. FACS enables computers to identify human emotions in picutres, and aslo videos. In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" The author states that in the famous Mona Lisa picute by Copy Leonardo

Da Vinci the renasissance painting. The painting of Mona Lisa her facial expersion was "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""There is no way that technology can scan a painting from the 1600's and find the painting facial expression out.

In paragraph 4 the author says "" ""The facial expresions for each emotion universal observes Dr. Huang"" "" ."" even though indivisuals often vary degrees of expression "". Dr. Huang is saying that it is impossible to find out someones emotions in a photo of them. In paragrah 3 the author says "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face ; all 44 major mucels in the model must move like human muscels."" The author is saying that there is no possible way that a computer can scan a persons exspression in a photo because of the the camreas frame and the movement of the person in the photo.

In paragraph 7 the author says "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" The Mona Lisa painting was in the 1600's it is impossible to figure out what was her expression. The author goes deep into the article to tell the reader that technology can't identify human emotions. In paragraph 6 the author says "" Tyhe Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face while it shows just how much this computer can do."" The author is explaing how technology is syncing into students brain and mind.

In parargraph 5 the author says "" In fact,we humans perform this same impressive ''calculation'' every day. For instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" The author is saying us humans have questions about others expressions.

F244,"using facial expresions are a good way to tell someone u are mad or happy. but sometimes u cant tell the diffrence unless people smile all the time. for instince when i walk i have a mean face that dosent mean im mad i could be happy but its just how my face is. u shouldnt need technology to tell someone if your happy ot sad all they gotta do is look at your face and they should already know if your mad or sad.

if the person isnt sure they should ask and see wether if your mad or sad. mona lisa smiling is just showing that shes happy or that she was happy while taking the picture. to be honest i think u can smile and feel something other than happiness. like when someone is mad and they smile just to seem like there happy.

i really dont get how u can calculate emotions like its an emoiton not a math question u either ask if the person is mad or sad or u just guess off the facial expressions. thats how i see it in my eyes itll be much easier to just ask then to do reasurch.

i think the smile should be used to show happiness people can be happy for just a moment then change there face which i understand i do it all the time. mad face should show if your mad. sad face should show that your sad. it shouldnt have to involve technology to find out how the person feels. mona lisa is a wonderful painting but i think she was happy in the picture because she smiled.","

""[Essay Content: F244 / using facial expresions are a good way to tell someone u are mad or happy. but sometimes u cant tell the diffrence unless people smile all the time. for instince when i walk i have a mean face that dosent mean im mad i could be happy but its just how my face is. u shouldnt need technology to tell someone if your happy ot sad all they gotta do is look at your face and they should already know if your mad or sad.

if the person isnt sure they should ask and see wether if your mad or sad. mona lisa smiling is just showing that shes happy or that she was happy while taking the picture. to be honest i think u can smile and feel something other than happiness. like when someone is mad and they smile just to seem like there happy.

i really dont get how u can calculate emotions like its an emoiton not a math question u either ask if the person is mad or sad or u just guess off the facial expressions. thats how i see it in my eyes itll be much easier to just ask then to do reasurch.

i think the smile should be used to show happiness people can be happy for just a moment then change there face which i understand i do it all the time. mad face should show if your mad. sad face should show that your sad. it shouldnt have to involve technology to find out how the person feels. mona lisa is a wonderful painting but i think she was happy in the picture because she smiled.]""

F245,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author introduced a new technology. It is called the Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to identify human emotions. Those emotions can be portrayed on a human or on a painting scuh as, The Mona Lisa. This new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable. It is valuable because it can figure out exactly what someone was feeling and it could help schools.

Now, figuring out exactly what someone was or is feeling may not be so important to you. It could be very important though. For example, in the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", paragraph 1, the author tells us exactly how Mona Lisa was feeling. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. For the moste part she was happy right? But what about the 17% of her feelings that were filled with disgust, fear, and anger. Whatwas causing those feelings. Think about it. If we can figure out exact emotions of people from the past, we could dig in and find out a lot more about our world's history. Those 17% of emotions could be nothing at all, but what if it was a major. What if it was something we didn't know about her.

This new technology could also help out schools. In aragraph 6, the author talks about how the Facial Action Coding System could potentially improve classrooms. That would result in smarter people in this world which is great. The technology could read your facial expressions to see if you are bored. If you are bored, then the technology could improve the classroom to be more interesting to you. If you are more interested in the subject at hand, then you will understand it better. If you understand it better, you will have better grades and have more knowledge. This will ultimately result in smarter people in the world.

So the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It can help us find exact emotions of a person. It could help us with with our schooling. We could find out so much more about our world and increase the IQs of others. This system could be so important for our world. ","

F246,"Some may say that they need cars to get around. Some people love thier car and could never dream of giving it away. Some also don't care about cars that much. Well in Germany and Paris cars are banned, yes I said banned. Some people may be shocked at this but others not so much. Some may ask how do they get around places? Some might ask so do they just walk everywhere from place to place? Some may ask do they actually like living without a car? Some might not even agree with the whole banning cars thing and may have lots of other questions. Well if you wanna know the answer to those questions well read on. Pay attention while you're reading and as I explain to you why these people think life is better without cars.

Having a car is important to mom's especially to the mom's that have about three or more kids. Mom's have dudies to do including taking sons to soccer ball games. Well a mom in Vauban, Germany got rid of her car. She actullay enjoy being car-free, and get this seventy percent of Vauban's families don't own a car. Also fifty-seven percent of people sold their car just to live there, obvisously more and more people are agreeing with this no car thing, and they would much rather take buses and taxies.

Now am not saying that everyone will agree about banning cars, read on to see how the people in Parris disobeyed the no car rule and what happened to them. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay 22-euro (31 USD). The same would apply the next day for the odd-numbered plates. According to an international news agency headquartered in London almost four-thousand drivers were fined. Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Some people may not know the real reason that people try to limit car use or even ban it in some countries. Its to take away stress and to lower air pollution. In Bogota, Colombia they had a care-free day and it turned into a big hit. On this car-free day millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. Leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. You know but not everyone was willing to parcisepte in this event and those people faced twenty-five dollar fines. This program was set to sprend to other countries and it did. For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event, and they were happy.

In conclusion limiting car usage or even banning cars is a good way takes stress and lower pollution.

Having to drive around alot can put a lot of pressure on a person and the pressure is lifted when they dont have to drive anymore. Air pollution is bad there are already a lot of things polluting the air why not make cars one of things thats not polluting the air. Also there will be less car traffic noone likes being stuck in traffic. I think that limiting car usage is a good thing. It will save us in the long run.            ","

F247,"The author does not support his/her idea to study Venus very well. The author presents mostly negative effects on humans researching Venus. He or she should have showed more facts for their side then for the negative side of visiting Venus for research. There are many dangers with sending humans to research Venus and the author states this.

The author states in paragraph 3 ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venum. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" The author goes on to talk about how NASA had the idea to send a hovering vehicle over to Venus to explore but if the clouds are corrosive how do we know how far they go. The temperature at Venus is also dangerous conditions for humans.

The author states that NASA had ideas to study using the vehile or simplified electronics. In paragraph 7 it states ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" If we send electronics over there to get pictures and calculations how would we put it on the surface and take it off of the surface. The author needs more details about this idea before stating it as a good idea. The author thinks that the hovering 30 or so miles above Venus is not a good idea because the scientist can't get samples to study Venus's atmosphere. The author states ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduch a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The author isn't to worried about the humans getting sent up there and thinks they should do it in dangerous conditions.

The author states facts on previous missions but these do not support his/her idea. Previous missions to Venus were unmanned. The author also states in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If spacecraft didn't survive it how would humans.

The author needs more facts supporting his/her idea instead of against their idea. This article should be more like a argumentable essay with stating facts from both sides. The author makes this article more of a persuasive for the opposite of what they want. They need to get more facts and ideas for not only their side but for both sides. I think that this article was more opinionated rather than using facts to support the articIe.I also think the author did well with stating facts opposing his/her side but did not give me enough information to support their idea.

F248,"Do you think the Facial Action Coding is 100 percent valuable and correct? In my personal opinion I say no. I have three reason that can explain why this technology is not valuable. I could be frowning and be happy ,but showing a sign of joy. Don't always trust technology; it sometimes can lead in the wrong way. Im amuse that people are relying on technology to lead them in a direction that could be wrong.

In the article it said "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelging simply by the look on her face."" That's very incorrect because many times I'll ask my friend how she is feeling when she looks grumpy. She would say im good with me not knowing that because me thinking her facial expression is saying something different. People ask me all the time whats wrong with me when; I turn out to be just chilling. Some people natural look might just be a mug. I learned that the hard way its so very true.

Trusting technology can give you false information. I remember this time I sprained my foot. I went to the doctor to get in x-ray and the x-ray information was showing that nothing was wrong with it for a period of time. Although, im glad the doctor knew what he was doing ;he then figure out that the inner of my foot was spained. The bone was slightly bent and I needed time to heal it and recover. It sounds like the Facial Action Coding System is like a x-ray machine.

I understand that the Facial Action Coding System is a use of technology. With that being known we can believe that the technology want always be right. You can get stuff off the internet thats not true information, but yet it's a source of technology. Many people just go to get there information off of wikipedia for a research project. You never know if the stuff is true because any one can edit it. So you can compare the Facial Action Coding Sysytem with gettig information off of the internet these are both sources of technology.

Is it a possibility that the Facial Coding System is valuable? Yes but I wouldn't put all of my trust into it. Just because im frowning don't assume that something is wrong with me. Or if someone just has a mug as a look don't think that their mad. It can come back that your wrong. Believeing that everything with technology is true is very false. It a good chance that the technology is off. The Facial Coding Sysytem like a x-ray scanning. Sometimes it can give true information sometimes it can't.        ","

F249,"The author supports their idea very well. The story is very convincing to start off. The authornmakes sure to mention a lot of evidence to back up his/her statements. The author mentions a lot of facts with another fact to prove it is true. The author did good with trying to get their point across because of all the points they made to back up his statement.

The reason I think the author did good is because the author seemed to know what they were talking about.

The author mentions how Venus is most alike to Earth. Also that is just one of the many statements the author makes. The author had also used other statements to compare to why we could go to Venus. The author even gave their own idea on what think is possible. The author uses plenty of facts to help his idea and what he/she is trying to say. The author even says how NASA is working on approachesto study Venus and that helps make the essay even better. The author does not see his idea as a risk and more as a challenge. The author seeing it as a challenge shows he confidence in his idea. The author also uses how Venus has so many things alike with earth that it should be explored.

So all in all the author made a good essay and did well supporting his idea. The author was consistent with his/her idea.

The author made sure to use important facts to support their idea. The author was well rounded and did not seemed biased with their idea and was very convincing with what they said.","

F250,"I am all for Thomas Huang new invation. I think that the FACS is a grate invation we finaly have a way to see how people are feeling just by this computer. How this device works is that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then studys all 44 major muscles. Moving one or more mucsles is called an action unit. After that Dr. Huang relies on Dr. Pual Eckman, the creator of FACS to find out how the preson is feeling.

The FACS software can track facial movements even if your not smiling as broadly. Just when you think that is all it can do it can also identify mixed emotions each exspession is compared to a nertarl face showing on emotion. We humans can also do this, but we would have trouble describing each facial trait. Dr. Huang wants to do a test on Mona Lsa to see if she is really smiling or not. There going to use the software to see if it can tell use if she is or not.

as you can see this software is a grate tool i can see this devise helping use out a lot in the futer. If you are interested in doing this then go look at your self and then ask your partner if he or she knows what your feeling right now. I fell like we should have more people like Dr. Huang, and Dr Paul Eckman cuase the world is changing and we need to try to keep up and not fall be hind. Life is a intresting thing and what you do with it is all up to you. ","

""[Essay Content: F250 / I am all for Thomas Huang new invation. I think that the FACS is a grate invation we finaly have a way to see how people are feeling just by this computer. How this device works is that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then studys all 44 major muscles. Moving one or more mucsles is called an action unit. After that Dr. Huang relies on Dr. Pual Eckman, the creator of FACS to find out how the preson is feeling.

The FACS software can track facial movements even if your not smiling as broadly. Just when you think that is all it can do it can also identify mixed emotions each exspession is compared to a nertarl face showing on emotion. We humans can also do this, but we would have trouble describing each facial trait. Dr. Huang wants to do a test on Mona Lsa to see if she is really smiling or not. There going to use the software to see if it can tell use if she is or not.

as you can see this software is a grate tool i can see this devise helping use out a lot in the futer. If you are interested in doing this then go look at your self and then ask your partner if he or she knows what your feeling right now. I fell like we should have more people like Dr. Huang, and Dr Paul Eckman cuase the world is changing and we need to try to keep up and not fall be hind. Life is a intresting thing and what you do with it is all up to you. ]""

F251,"Limiting car usage has a lot of advantages in everyday life. Cars are the one destroying the planet. When the cars' smoke gets to the atmosphere, the atmosphere gets destroyed by it. If we destroy the atmosphere then what or who is going to take care of our planet from the powerful sunlight. Also limiting cars may also save you a lot of money. Think about all the money we spend on gas for cars, we can do a lot better for the world with all that money.

Now I'm going to talk about some evidence in the article that makes limiting car usage better for life. In source 1 ""In German Suburb, Life Goes Without Cars"", Heidrum Walter, a citizen from Vauban said that she lives happier without cars because when she had a car she was always tense (paragraph 3). Now in sourse 2 the article says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer of air to trap car emissions(paragraph 15), and that is really bad. Also in source 2 again the last paragraph says that the smog cleared when they banned the usage of cars.

In source 3 paragraph 24 Carlos Arturo a businessman from Bogota, Colombia said when Bogota's streets were car-free that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. At last, source 4 says that now that there is less driving, safety in the cities have improved.

So I say that we must limit car usage because of all the things i mensioned in the previous paragraphs. The city will be safer, the planet will be safer and everything will be better.            ","

F252,"Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not suprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the ""easy"" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, trolly's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, trolly's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollusion and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a  new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rush-hour. This means less time spent with family andmore tijme bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoides all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appretiate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our enviroment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.                            ","

F254,"Ever heard of using technology to read students' emotional expressions in a classroom? Of course not, because it is not necessary. What good would come out of scanning a student's face? The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" does not give many reasons on how this technology would benefit people. This technology is also a little confusing with giving information. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is unvaluable because it serves no real purpose, would cause confusing emotional problems, and we shouldn't have to rely on it.

By human nature, we can already tell or sense how someone around us is feeling. Why would we need the technology of reading someone's face when we can do that by looking at a person? Maybe not always, but for the most part we can tell when someone is feeling down or happy. In paragraph 5 of this article it states, ""...we humans perform this same impressive ""calculaion"" every day... you can probably tell how a friends is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This supports how this technology is not exactly needed.

""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Which is it? Is she happy or angry? Why is she disgusted and fearful when she's mainly happy? This technology would describe several different emotions that one is feeling. Because of this, it would be confusing to really understand someone. In paragraph 4 it states, ""Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This supports how people do show various emotions, so it would be confusing, whereas without the technology, people can question each other and converse.

Why rely on this technology instead of actually communicating?

We are people, and in a classroom, bonds can easily be made. Therefor, we can talk to each other in order to discuss emotions. Paragraph 6 states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" Even though having this technology where ""it could modify the lesson,"" would be helpful, it's not something we can't do ourselves by talking. Paragraph 6 also states, ""...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows the technology would be beneficial in a way, but it's not valuable nor necessary.

This technology to read the emotonal expressions of students in a classroom is not valuavble due to not having a good enough purpose for use, it's confusing; almost unreliable, and we can communicate without it. In a classroom, we should be able to express our emotions without the technology. We can verbally discuss topics and share. This technology would not be as valuable as a good teacher, tutor, or instructor. ","

F255,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

In the artical the author informes his or her reader that ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

""In the text the author starts off his senteces with ""Long ago,"" This simply proves ""no spacraft survived the landing for more than a hours,"" which is also stated in the text in paragraph 2. In paragraph 2 the author also states Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is making it clear it want be easy doing research on Venus.

In the text paragraph 3 states ""A thick atmosphere of alomost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clounds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times than what we experience on our own planet.""

The author is make his or her point how exploring Venus can be very challenging.

In the text the author states ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

The author is making it clear as posible of the danger that comes along with studying Venus's atmosphere. The author states in paragraph 5 ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA) has one particularly compelling ideal for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the Hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" The author is backing up his or her claim by using a outsiders voice. In this case The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

In the text the author state in paragraph 7 "" NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.""Once again the author is using a outsiders voice to state his or her claim. The textes also states in paragraph 7 "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll."" The author is just interducing some of the project he or she had in mind.

In the text the author states in paragraph 8 ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has Value not only beacuse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also beacuse human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and Beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

The author is simply resting his or her claim, based on the suggestion they made to study Venus, and why they think Venus is worthy pursuit the dangers it presents.  ","

""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Computers can use this technology to see when a student in a classroom understands what he or she is doing and adjust the work so that he or she can learn better. This new technology can revolutionize the world of education.

This new technology could be extreamly valuble in a classroom. The benefits of this technology can change the way that students learn for the better. In a classroom, the teacher doesn't always know if the student understands their work or not, but now the computer can do it for the teacher. The computer can tell if the student is confused or bored, so it can adjust the questions to fit the students needs. This technology is revolutionary and can change the world of education for the better.]""

F257,"Today I will be talking about my opinon on driverless cars. I think that driverless cars are not really that safe because if cars have trouble with actual human driving them what makes people think to make cars without humans driving them. I also didnt think General Motors created a concept car that could run on special test tracks because, I asked my grandma who is a retired lady from General Motors and she had no clue at the time.

There are a lot of people in this world that have many different opinions about cars that can go places without a human driving it. Cars can be smart at times like it says in the passage but, there not that smart to not have a person behind the wheel in my perspective. I think that would cause a lot more accidents and there's already enough of those every day.

I can say one thing though. If we could have a car without a person driving it that can be good for people that does not like strangers in cabs driving them around so maybe if there was cars without humans driving them that would be good and people could be a lot more comfortable. Also, that could prevent kidnapping as well. Because i've read articles about people getting kidnapped by a cab driver which could be the worst feeling ever.

For the most part, there are good and bad ways to not have a human driving a moving vehical. But not all good opions are safe either. Even though many others could have different responses and opions about how they think about driverless cars, these are jus mine.","

F258,"Being able to read the emotional expressions of students can be innovating. Many student can have problems, but with this technology it can be solved in minutes. The use of this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students because if the student is having problems the teacher can help them with their problems, the teacher is aware of what her students emotional expressions are, and other students can help other students according to what emotional expressions they show.

The use of this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because if the student is having problems with their emotions the teacher can help them out. According to the passage it states "" Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This means thats as the machine shows the emotinal expressions of the student the teacher can see what he or she is lacking in and maybe help with that.

The use of this technology is valuabke to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom because the teacher is aware of what the students emotional expressions are. Accoridng to the passage ""there is new computer software that cna recognize emotions."" This means that the teacher is going to be aware if what her students emotionak expressions are going to be.

The use of this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because other students can help other students according to what emotional expressions they show. According to the passage this machine can detect facial movement to see what the emotional expression is about the student. Therefore this means that other students can help other student if, lets say for example if a student is 90 percent disgusted, then other student can help her to feel better.

This technology could be innovating to many schools in the world. It can help detect if students could be depressed, or have trouble at home, it can help teachers to help their students out. All in all this tchnology is valuable because it can help a lot of kids from suicide or many more things because if the machine detects that they are depressed the teachers can help.

F259,"9When looking at the world from a birds eye view, it is possible to see the beauty in the world; Even so, in certain developed and developing areas, the people are choking. The choking is not just supported by the violated environment, but along with that, society is an advocate for the pain of the people. An intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars. With the progressing world also comes regress, and according to an article wrriten by the New york times in 2013, it was stated that in countries such as the United states of America, ""Americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each yeat goes by."" This eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the U.S.A. Although the car industry may suffer from this, it is essential to note that, the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public. In fact, in the long run, the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole. This can be seen in three major ways, with first, public benefits , second, cheaper and time-saving methods , and finally the unmatched environmental benefits .

As people continue to choke from the pain, it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem, and limiting car usage is the definately one of the best ways to reduce the harms. The public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress , more space , and increased saftey . Starting off with stress, Heidrun Walter, a mother of two children stated that she was ""always tense"" when she had a car. she now lives in the German city of Vauban. Here most people have given up on cars, including Mrs. Walter. As a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation. With Mrs. Walter, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". These people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit. Moving toward space, an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in 2009, states in this new approach, we will have make it so there is less space for parking. With less space for cars, there is more space for people. Not only that but with the increased limit, there is a decrease in traffic. Traffic can be extremely long, and in this case it will help to increase public space. Although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety, in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat. Therefore, with their limit, there can be an increase in safety for the people. Moving back to Mrs. Walter, she as a mother of two did want the best for her children, and above all comes their saftey. Meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces.

Although people do want to benefit as individuals, it really comes down to the cost at the end point. But limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person. In fact, by limiting cars, alternate transportation is promoted. Countries such as Colombia, have move on to bicycles. The major of Bogota(a city in colombia) said that due to the limitation of cars for a day ""It has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"". This is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars. This means that transport would be so much more affordable. Now with the increase in bicycle travel, there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic. And although cars are much faster than bicycles, the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel, bicycle travel will be more efficient. This ultimately means that by limiting car usage, transportation will be cheaper, and it will be just as efficient, if not more. It can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel, but David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes. By limiting car usage, these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation. Indeed in the end  Vauban is correct in calling this ""smart planning"".

Now comes out the benefits everyone knows about: the environmental benefits. Smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world. In countries such as China, it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog, daily. But what may not be as common to people is that a country such as France has also started to see a similiar problem. Pollution in France is actually rivaled by Beijing(one of the most polluted countries in the world) as reported by the Chicago tribune on 2014. Cars have been the major cause of this, considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by cars. In fact an article named ""The end of car culture"" states that cars are one of the highest sources for carbon emissions. By limiting car usage, cities such as Bogota and Paris, faced amazing results. Overall by limiting car usage the environment benefits exponentially.

In the end the solution to the people choking in the world, is simple: limiting car usage. The advantages of this limitation can be seen with benefits to socitey. This can be seen with public benefits, cheaper and time saving methods and of course the environmental benefits.                                            ","

F260,"We all need to have a break right? Well,now Google wants to create a driverless car in the future. In this argumentative essay I will talk about how we should have driverless cars in the future and how beneficial it can be.

I think that driverless cars are better and they should be allowed because some people drive from twelve hours to there destination and even thirty-two hours from their destination. I would say it is a good idea because some familys take road trips and the driver is usually very tired after hours of driving in the same position. According to paragraph one,Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that such cars would fundementally change the world,and personally,it could change my dads world. Also,we need driverless cars becuase some people drive at night and their sight and brain can be unconscious and have a wreck. Driving at night can be and will be very exhausting,but if you are too tired to even pay attention to the road,the best thing to do is to lay down in your car and let the car do its own thing.

Another reason I think it should be allowed is because of all the reckless driving there is in this world. Of course,according to paragraph seven,Google didnt extend the possibilites of having a successful driverless car. They just made the driverless car not really driverless. I mean,in paragraph seven it states clearly that the car will have a sensor in order for the passenger in the drivers seat to take action whenever there is an accident or upcoming traffic. In someway it sounds helpful but in another way it just sounds as if the driver is still driving no matter what. They should create driverless cars becuase some people have accidents and can result in death. So,to avoid that we need those driverless cars,we need something that can be useful for people who are seniors and when they are drunk or are just learning to drive. Also,we do need it for the people who take road trips or the people who have business trips and just have to drive for hours.

My third reason on which we should have driverless cars is that we might want to see and enjoy the view of the outside. The passangers are not a problem when coming to viewing the outside world through their window,but the passanger will get exhausted just looking straight infront of him. We need to think that the driver also wants a little taste of what is out there to see. Like my mom,she likes to see out in the window but she cant because she has to keep her focus infront of her. Our brain can also go to a point where it can get exhausted and they eyesight fails some of the time it fails and the accidents happen.

In conclusion,we should have driverless cars because they will be useful for all of us,especially the ones who have to drive for hours just to get to their destination. It will also be helpful for the people who drive at night. Some people cant even see at night and they just crash. So,I think that we should have driverless cars because it will be beneficial for all of us.","

F263,"I think using this technology in a classroom would be a huge breakthrough. Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. So the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.

This technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.

Humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now. For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.

In conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.                                 ","

F265,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

F269,"These article that are given to me have good reasons why we may not need cars as time passes by, and their advantages.

In the first article, it gives many reasons why some people in Germany dont need, or used cars. In the third paragraph, second sentence, a women states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Meaning, that she probably had a lot of issues when she had a car, maybe it was engine problems, battery, or maybe the gas prices that they used to have, but now she can relaxe, not having to deal with any engine problems, battery problems, or the gas prices, now that she doesn't own a car. Now she probably just has a bike, and bike are really easy to fix, not like a car were you have to pay someone to fix it for you, also pay for items that the person fixing your car has used. Basically some people in Germany are trying to save money, and have found a way to do it.

Next, the second article and the third article, take on one of the most important thing, our planet. In the two article it gives alot of reasons why a car is banned from Paris and Bogota, Colombia, but the one that captures me the most would be on the paragraph 17, were it states ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Showing that Paris has noticed a problem and are actually doing something about it. They have banned cars to see if that is the actual problem, and they have found out that the cars are the problem. And they're answer to that problem is to set a fine to those people that had their cars with even numbered licence plates on Mondays and odd numbered licenced plates on the following day. Paris then got the results, if the cars were the problem, and yes it was, there was less smog, so they had decided to leave the fine. And in the third article, it shows that also Colombia is taking part of a smog free place. But they instead decide to ban cars and only give permission to buses and taxi drivers to drive. But they don't only give bus drivers and taxi drivers osmething to enjoy, the have also given their people ways to enjoy a place without cars. They have fixed their old, beat-up sidewalks and have put more bicycle trails for people that don't drive buses or taxis.

Last but not least, in the last article it shows that even a powerful and strong nation can also take part of helping the planet, by lowering its most known culture, driving. It might seem like America is taking a part of helping the planet, by lowering the number of cars, and drivers. The statement that captures my attention the most would be ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."" Meaning that a nation were young people would come to lead it in the future, some have decided to do it by hard work. Some would lead it by doign it in the hard, but basically simple way, driving.

In conclusion, those are my reasons to why limiting car usage have its advantages, by saving money, peoples lives, and our planet.    ","

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F269 / These article that are given to me have good reasons why we may not need cars as time passes by, and their advantages.

In the first article, it gives many reasons why some people in Germany dont need, or used cars. In the third paragraph, second sentence, a women states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Meaning, that she probably had a lot of issues when she had a car, maybe it was engine problems, battery, or maybe the gas prices that they used to have, but now she can relaxe, not having to deal with any engine problems, battery problems, or the gas prices, now that she doesn't own a car. Now she probably just has a bike, and bike are really easy to fix, not like a car were you have to pay someone to fix it for you, also pay for items that the person fixing your car has used. Basically some people in Germany are trying to save money, and have found a way to do it.

Next, the second article and the third article, take on one of the most important thing, our planet. In the two article it gives alot of reasons why a car is banned from Paris and Bogota, Colombia, but the one that captures me the most would be on the paragraph 17, were it states ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Showing that Paris has noticed a problem and are actually doing something about it. They have banned cars to see if that is the actual problem, and they have found out that the cars are the problem. And they're answer to that problem is to set a fine to those people that had their cars with even numbered licence plates on Mondays and odd numbered licenced plates on the following day. Paris then got the results, if the cars were the problem, and yes it was, there was less smog, so they had decided to leave the fine. And in the third article, it shows that also Colombia is taking part of a smog free place. But they instead decide to ban cars and only give permission to buses and taxi drivers to drive. But they don't only give bus drivers and taxi drivers osmething to enjoy, the have also given their people ways to enjoy a place without cars. They have fixed their old, beat-up sidewalks and have put more bicycle trails for people that don't drive buses or taxis.

Last but not least, in the last article it shows that even a powerful and strong nation can also take part of helping the planet, by lowering its most known culture, driving. It might seem like America is taking a part of helping the planet, by lowering the number of cars, and drivers. The statement that captures my attention the most would be ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.""

F270,"I think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classrooms because it would help to see the emotions of kids. Like see if they need help or if they aren't feeling good. Mostly things like that. You could also use it to see if kids are lying or not when they get in trouble and have to go to the principle or when they get in trouble at home.

Mona Lisa: 83% happy, 9% disgusted , 6% fearful, and 3% angry! When Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 we had no clue how she was really feeling. But with the FACS it is now easy to see how she was feeling. That is a good thing because it could help us in the future with life or death situations.

F271,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", brings the reader to light on the argument on whether or not scientist should keep trying land spacecrafts or humans on Venus.

An arguement can be made for either side and is just a matter of opionion.

The author conveys her opionion well in the passages, but she doesn't make a compelling case for her side of the argument. The author doesn't give enough reasonable support to back up her claims.

To begin with, the amount of danger that is on Venus's surface and atmosphere poses too big of a challenge for scientists to reasonably accomplish. As it says in the passage, Venus is converes in almost 97% carbon dioxide and the temperature and pressure arounf 90 times greater than what we usually experience on Earth, making Venus's surface temperature around 800 degree. If anyone probes that touchdown on Venus don't get destoyed by any of those, there's a likely chance it'll get destroyed by its frequent lighting storms, earthquakes and volcanoes.

The author claim to the soultion to these challenges are also highly unrealistic. The author states that humans can explore Venus by contructing a vehicle that hovers 30+ miles above the surface. The author gives this solution but doesn't give any support to how it will be accomplished and doesn't give answer to questions like, ""How will they transport a blimp to Mars?"", "" How they enter Mars atmophere without landing first?"" or ""What will power this?"" (If it's constantly in the air that will takeup a lot of fuel.)

One last backset to the author's plan is, how will it be funded? The bills will start racking up everytime a probe is destroyed by Venus's surface and they have to spend millions of more dollars building and sending another spacecraft to Venus. No countries or companies want to spend billions of dollars on a mission that they mat have a chancce of lerning some information about Mars.

The author goals and solutions are just too unrealistics with this day and age's technologies. It is advanced but not advanced to overcome the obsticals that Vensus present. Some day in the future we may be advance enough to achieve this goal.","

F272,"The author supports his opinion very well by giving good reasons why it would be a great leap forward if we were to explore the our ""Sister planet."" he even gave examples of how we could explore it with even being in such a dangerous enviroment, as he said in the in the story"" imagine a blimp like vehicle hover 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape."" Even thought it's a dangerous mission if we send more unmaned ships and drones to venus we could find a easier way to send the first human there.

The author also sates some of the downsides such as ""A thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus."" And he also states ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degress fahrenheit."" which would be deadly for any human without a special suit. Even though this mission could put

somebody's life at risk is could still be a huge leap forward for space travel and the exploration of the universe. If the world were to ever collaspe unto itself we as a race would need to sutible planet to make our new home, And if we make venus safe for humans in my opinion that would be one of the top choices.

In conclusion venus is a very dangerous planet, but if scientist just study the planet for a long time, We might be able to make it suitable for a man or woman to finally explore the surface of our "" Sister Planet."" This may take years or even centuries but the author firmly believes that if we just keep sending ships and drones that we can have enough knowlege to explore the planet further.","

F273,"I think the idea of being able to see other kids emotions or feelings from a computer is a bad idea. No one should know what the kid is going through unless that kid wants you to know he or she will tell you.

If the kid wants it to be private or can't tell anyone anything then they don't want others to know at all. If they are mad they shouldn't take it out on someone else. They could maybe ask a close friend or teacher or parent for help or ask them what they should do. He or she could be going through a lot at home or with grades or a bully that makes he or she mad. Parents need to ask there kids and wonder are they doing ok in school is everything alright if there kid is showing emotions for being mad or sad then they should be concerned. Most kids will be to scared to tell others cause they think they will get into trouble so they just stay quiet. Some kids take the pain out on there selfs and harm there selfs or worse. The kid shouldn't be asking what to do cause they are to scared. The guardian, teacher, friend or someone close should be asking them are you ok or im here for you then the kid will speak up and talk.

My opion on whether the computer should read kids expressions is no that's the parents job or guardian computers don't run are life's and the guardian should know if there kid is doing ok or not and help them instead of a computer helping them on there life situations.","

F274,"Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom. First it could appeal differently to each students larning style, or be modified to teach him/her how the student wants. Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/she likes the lesson. This could help children learn alot better in a learning enviroment tailored just for them.

First, it could appeal differently to each student. This means that if it notices a kid frowning when showed a hard problem or a large group of text, it could change what it is doing but keeps the concept of what it is teaching. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" This shows that the program could be used for the betterment of teaching for different people, not all people learn the same way, so why should it all be taught the same way. The computer could fix that by modifying the way it teaches.

Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/she likes the lesson. If a student, me especially, dosen't like a lesson or thinks it is boring, he/she wont learn. A computer that reads faces to get the emotions of students would keep the lesson being taught livley and more fun to keep students entertained. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" I used the same quote twice once in the second paragraph and now, in this paragraph becauses it strongly supports both of my claims. If a computer where to ""modify the lesson, like an effective instructor"" students would always be engaged in learning because the lesson would always change to what is needed to keep students entertained.

If used in a classroom, it would greatly keep students engaged in learning. personally, I would love having something like this in the classroom to keep me interested in the lesson.

F275,"""Paul"", Luke said ""do you want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program?""

""Uhm I'm not sure luke, why would I join the Seagoing Cowboys program, like give me an idea of what it would be like"" Paul said

""Well you get to help out Europe and China by giving them horses, baby cows, goats and so on."", Luke said, ""You also get to see so many natural wonders, antiques, buildings from long long ago, and meet so many new and great people""

""Sounds fun but what about my kids and wife,they will miss me, and who will be man of the house after all I only have two girls with a mother that is sick. I'm sorry Luke I just can't go to many things to worry about"".

""Well why didn't you tell me that i would've got that taken care of no questions asked"", Luke said, ""I can call up your brother have him come up here and take care of the house and call a docter to take care of your wife, I know you would've called a docter if you had the money to, but I will pay for the docter visiting so you don't have to woory about money"".

In the meantime Luke called Dr. Philipe, (phil-EY-pay) called Saul, Paul's brother, asked if he could house sit for Paul, and payed for the docter visit and Saul's trip.

""So Paul, now can you go?"", Luke said

""Yes I can go"", said Paul

On the way to the Luke's barn that was on a hil next to the lake, they found multiple holes in the ground that hadn't been there before. ""I wonder where these came from?""

""Me too, maybe a giant worm or a mole"", Paul said

""Let's follow the holes to see where the main source is"". They followed the holes and it led them to the barn. They heard a lot of noise from the horses then the cows and then the chickens. ""What's going on in here"", Luke said. ALmost right after he said that he spotted a cottenmouth snake on of the most deadliest snakes of all, besides the viper.

""Oh my chicken nuggets, it's a snake"", Paul screamed. The snake heard Paul scream and turned around to face Paul. The sake bunched up and Luke said, ""Run!"" Paul was to late. The snake bit him on his ankle and Paul fell to the floor. Luke grabbed an iron horse shoe and threw it at the snake, missed the first time, but the second hit the snake in the head.

""Get away from my friend!"" Yelled Luke, ""Or I'll through another one!"" The snake just stayed there hissing at Luke. Luke threw another one and hit the snake again and killed the snake. Luke threw the dead snake out of the barn and got all the venom out of Paul.

""Lets go now"", Luke said. They left and was on the boat untill one of the horses saw a spider and ran towrds land. ""Let's just leave it after all we have 337 horses"", said Paul.

They left and was having the time of their lifes, seeing all type of sea creatures and weird fish. They made it to Europe and delived the animals safe and sound.

""So did you have fun?"" asked Luke.

""Yes, it is fun to get out of the house and two screaming girls and enjoy life while we still can"", said Paul

They made it to homeland and had the best welcome back party of their lifes. Luke said bye to Paul when Paul went on his next trip and Luke went home to do house chores. They never saw each other again because it was said that there was a storm that year and the SS WiIlington 370 capsized in the water and was never seen again. That was the story of Paul and Luke, the Seagoing Cowboys.","

On the way to the Luke's barn that was on a hil next to the lake, they found multiple holes in the ground that hadn't been there before. ""I wonder where these came from?""

""Me too, maybe a giant worm or a mole"", Paul said

""Let's follow the holes to see where the main source is"". They followed the holes and it led them to the barn. They heard a lot of noise from the horses then the cows and then the chickens. ""What's going on in here"", Luke said. ALmost right after he said that he spotted a cottenmouth snake on of the most deadliest snakes of all, besides the viper.

""Oh my chicken nuggets, it's a snake"", Paul screamed. The snake heard Paul scream and turned around to face Paul. The sake bunched up and Luke said, ""Run!"" Paul was to late. The snake bit him on his ankle and Paul fell to the floor. Luke grabbed an iron horse shoe and threw it at the snake, missed the first time, but the second hit the snake in the head.

""Get away from my friend!"" Yelled Luke, ""Or I'll through another one!"" The snake just stayed there hissing at Luke. Luke threw another one and hit the snake again and killed the snake. Luke threw the dead snake out of the barn and got all the venom out of Paul.

""Lets go now"", Luke said. They left and was on the boat untill one of the horses saw a spider and ran towrds land. ""Let's just leave it after all we have 337 horses"", said Paul.

They left and was having the time of their lifes, seeing all type of sea creatures and weird fish. They made it to Europe and delived the animals safe and sound.

""So did you have fun?"" asked Luke.

""Yes, it is fun to get out of the house and two screaming girls and enjoy life while we still can"", said Paul

They made it to homeland and had the best welcome back party of their lifes. Luke said bye to Paul when Paul went on his next trip and Luke went home to do house chores. They never saw each other again because it was said that there was a storm that year and the SS WiIlington 370 capsized in the water and was never seen again. That was the story of Paul and Luke, the Seagoing Cowboys.]""

F276,"Dear state senator,

By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts . I belive that some of the people that do want to become president someday will not become that because their votes mainly deals with the electoral colloges and what they really when the counts of the votes should be really counted off what the people of the united states really think or who they think our president should really be. Some people think we should have a black president or a white president green,purple,or blue it really doesnt matter in my opinion i think i am speaking for everyone when i say that wewant a person that would make great descisions for the umited states a person that is welling to go above and beyond to make our countrymore better and a safe place to all . And at the end of the day people in america doesnt want or think that it is right to have a female president sitting in the seat of a president,i say simply because the people of the USA doesnt think women have enough power or orders, or authority i think women should have the same rights as men. But at the end of the day i think that the people of the united states should have a right to choose who they want to serve as or president , someone who would make change and make the USA a better and safer place for everyone. Someone whois very well educated and have a outlook or reach of things. It shouldnt be based off the electoral colleges because america might disagree with their descison and cause a whole lot of chaos.         ","

F277,"I think that using the techonogy to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable because it help to see if a student is happy/mad/sad .Like in the passage it's talking about how they are using this new technology call ''The Facial Action coding system ''Which mean -a system enables computers to identify human emotions . They are aslo using the 3-D computer model of the face ,As they can aslo calculate the emotions . As because you can see what is wrong with your friend/family .

One reason why I think it's valuable for technology to read your emontional expressoion on studnets is by the promgram ''Facial Action Coding System'' why because just by using a video as it sates in the passage 4 ''using video imagery the new eemotion recognition software tracks these facial movements ''they can see what kind of emontion you have and for them to help you out I am guessing or at less it can be valube for making them feel better .Also because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them .I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/daad get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad .

It aslo can be valuable for student's in school because in that way you can help them out to feel better or sometines you just don't know wehn that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling .Another reason why it can help on students with the new technolongy by the imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by the imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad .This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way becasue sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know should't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by casuing harm .As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example .''If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow .But if you frown the next ad will be different .''A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored '' As Dr. Hiangs predicts then he could modity thr lesson because they want the student's to pay attion in the classroom for them to learn and not make the class boring or for student to get lost and never asking question but as that to then the teacher will know what makes them get bored and what makes them get fouces . This will help for many toher student in school by not causing hram if they mad and aslo by helping student not get bored or lose fouces .

Now on my personal life I will say that the technolngy will help me by seeing how are people feeling when I see them walking around with there face down or just seeing them happy .Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hall way and see my freind wih a serious face or just them not talking to I will like to use the technolgy and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood .Another reason why I will like to help is by seeing how does my mom feel when she looks at me like just take a picture of her and see what are the emotion she has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make her look at her self in the mirror and follow the steps it say and see what are the emotion she has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expressio for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many awlays

As you see I do valuable the technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a class because it can help in many way to see the way they are feeling in there emotion and in there way of learing .Just like Dr. Huang he doesnt want his student to lose fouces and doesnt want them to feel sad either .Just like it will help in school for the student's .Also as using the 3-D computer mood just by seeing an imagine it can see what kind of feeling you are having . As yes it will be value to use later in ;life well it will help me with my friends and even my own kids and students at schools .    ","

F278,"Would you risk your life to search for answers that might just end up dissapointing you? Well I'm asssuming that the author of this article would. The author talks more about the bad things about Venus than the good things, which doesn't help his/her claim that it ""is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". In this article, the author talks more about the hardships Venus's enviroment would provide than the benefits, he/she talks about how hard it would be to build a spacecraft to even withstand Venus's envirmonet, and he/she doesnt't provide any points or ideas to why we should want to visit there.

The author mentions that Venus's atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide. Not only is the atmosphere 97 percent carbon dioxide, it also contains ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"". Temperatures on Venus average around 800 degrees fahrenheit, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet, which would be impossible to maintian human life, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times what we have here on earth. All of paragraph 3 is just talking about the negative's of Venus, which doesn't support the authors claim that these risks are worth finding out any information.

In paragraph five, the author talks about how NASA is trying to build a spacecraft that can withstand Venus's envirmonet. He/she explains in paragraph 2 that no spacecraft that has been sent to Venus has ever survived the landing for more than a few hours. The author talks about how NASA wants to build a blimp that will hover 30 miles above the surface of Venus so that is can avoid the harsh conditions on the surface, although right after this, he/she states that even 30 miles up off the surface, Venus is still going to be around 170 degrees Farenheit. The extremly high air pressure, heat, harsh storms, etc will all have to be concidered when trying to build a spacecraft that will be able to survive on Venus. Once again, these paragraphs are not explainging much good that is coming out of a manned trip to Venus.

Throughout the article, the author talks about very little benefits that come when sending a man to Venus. Scientists do believe that Venus was once covered with large oceans and might have had a variety of life forms. But this means nothing to us now if it's all destroyed. We will never for sure know if there was once life there, all of the evidence is gone. Honestly, what is the point in even going to Venus? Temperatures of 800 degrees would have burnt everything. Besides, why does is matter to us if there was once life there? We should focus on Earth and how we need to start taking care of it, before it ends up like Venus. There was no solid point in this article that honestly pursuaded me to want to send someone to visit Venus.

In conclusion, I do not think the author supported his claim well, he talked more about the negative parts of Venus, about how hard it would be to build something to trasport them there, and he/she never really states anything persuading the reader about why it would be good to visit Venus. Although it would be intresting to find out stuff about Venus's past, no one will ever know the absolute truth. ","

F279,"Humans must continue to study Venus as it is know to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. With NASA stating that it is possible to send humans to Venus, we must do it to gather information on how Venus use to be like Earth and then how it became impossible to live on. The author uses logos to inform the reader on how to get a human to Venus. If a human were to go to venus he/she would stay about thirty miles above the surface where it is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure is normal and solar power would be very useful. With these conditions it is possible to send a human to Venus.

Although Venus can be accessed by humans, the information scientist really want is on the surface. Sending a human to the surface is death but, scientist are working on a machine made of silicon carbide. The silicon carbide material can withstand the awful conditions of Venus for about 3 weeks. 3 weeks is enough time to gather rocks, dust, gas, and other objects on the surface. All of this information that the author says is building a compeling reason to study Venus.

The author does a great job pursuading the reader into wanting to explore Venus. He/she uses the rhetorical strategy pathos when he/she said that Venus is the most Earth-like planet and that the misson is survivable for humans. That gets the reader wanting to see how it all ended for Venus and also, makes the reader feel excited in wanting to learn more. The author also states strategys to the process of exploring Venus which gives the reader hope that it can happen.","

F280,"I think it is valuable to use this technology in schools or what ever there is they want to know or use them for or even on other things, beacuse you want to know if your students are sad or what they are feeling like on a day to day bases.

Since some kids dont really tell you whats going on with their life, and you see them sad or crying but they wont tell you what they are feeling like. So I think you can use these. I think students will find very interesting these computer models, beacuse they have 3-D cumputer models that recognize their faces and get every little muscle of their face to make almost like a replica in order to see the facil expressions you make, like when the cumputer recognises your face it shows if you like something or not like the ads on your phone.

If you like it it shows more like those you just watched, but sometimes In my opinion, feel like it just wants you to stay on your phone and kepp being on it, and I find it kind of creepy that it knows your face and the way you feel. But for the most part teen and other people would like these in a cool way to use. Just like they tried using it on a Mona Lisa painting to see what she was feeling back then, beacause she looked like she was very mad at somthing.

But other wise i think it will be great and i think they should use them in schools. I find it very interesting for many students and myself to use, I think they should allow it in many schools         ","

The author states in paragraph 4, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" The reason stated supports the authors idea because without a reason to study Venus there would likely be very little reason to justify studing Venus without a proper incentive.

The author explains in paragraph 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" If there were no explanation on why it would be diffucult to study Venus there would be no way for scientists to figure out solutions to the various problems of studying Venus.

The author then goes on to explain possible solutions for the obstacles of studing Venus. The author states in paragraph 7, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."" The author also states in paragraph 7, ""...some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" By explaining possible solutions the author proves that there is hope in studying and that attempting to study Venus isn't a futile effort.

F288,"As the world begins to grow and expand, many people have found that living without cars can be more beneficial. Cities and suburbs around the world, have found that reducing car usage has a grest number of advantages. This is reducing pollution, and is reducing stress. The world is shifting into a new way of life, not involving cars.

Cars release a large amout of greenhouse gases into the atmospere every single day, and this is harming the environment. Experts explain that, ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Rosenthal), have been taking place in suburban communities in Germany. This has resulted with a, ""12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal). Also, Paris has seen near-record amounts of pollution and smog in the city, so the global city has limited motorists' driving on two days of the week, Monday and Tuesday. The climate in Paris, ""[causes] the warm layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Duffer), thoughout the atmospere in the city, but the limitation on motorists at the beginning of the week has allowed the smog to clear up.

Helping the environment is not the only benefit of reducing car usage, yet it can also relieve stress in your eveeryday life. There is no need to stress out over traffic, finding somewhere to park, or even paying the expences that come with owning a car. In Germany, most residents don't own cars, and Heidrun Walter explained that she is, ""much happier this way"" (Rosenthal), because she doesnt have to worry about traffic. She has enjoyed a healthier life style that is stress free, by walking or biking to the places she needs to be. In Colombia, there is a day that citizens will not use cars, once a year. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees that, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" (Selsky). There is no need to worry about rush hour, or other traffic.

Others don't see the advantages of reducing car usage. Delivery companies complain about the loss in revenue, yet they aren't thinking about the benefits. They can save their employees from stressing out, or even help the environment. Reducing car usage would be a huge cultural shift, that has many advantages.    ","

Also, Paris has seen near-record amounts of pollution and smog in the city, so the global city has limited motorists' driving on two days of the week, Monday and Tuesday. The climate in Paris, ""[causes] the warm layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Duffer), thoughout the atmospere in the city, but the limitation on motorists at the beginning of the week has allowed the smog to clear up.

Helping the environment is not the only benefit of reducing car usage, yet it can also relieve stress in your eveeryday life. There is no need to stress out over traffic, finding somewhere to park, or even paying the expences that come with owning a car. In Germany, most residents don't own cars, and Heidrun Walter explained that she is, ""much happier this way"" (Rosenthal), because she doesnt have to worry about traffic. She has enjoyed a healthier life style that is stress free, by walking or biking to the places she needs to be. In Colombia, there is a day that citizens will not use cars, once a year. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees that, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" (Selsky). There is no need to worry about rush hour, or other traffic.

Others don't see the advantages of reducing car usage. Delivery companies complain about the loss in revenue, yet they aren't thinking about the benefits. They can save their employees from stressing out, or even help the environment. Reducing car usage would be a huge cultural shift, that has many advantages.    ]""

F290,"Using this new facial technology would be vastly benefital in the classroom. Students sit through seven hours of school a day and not every class is going to be their favorite, with this technology the school can figure out what lessons, classes, and teachers are making students the happiest and are the best. Many emotions go undetected, they cause bad grades, lack of motivation, and depression. Not only can the program detect emotions but can alert the teachers if a student needs help. It can prevent self harm, school targeties, and safety hazards. The system would not only help education wise but mental health wise, and create a safe environment to learn and grow as people.

Everyone has a different learning style, and if a teacher can see that that student is struggling and adjust the lesson for them, it would be very benefital for eveyone. Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". Many teachers ask thier students to ask questions as they are learning new content, but no questions are ever asked and bad tests scores come back. This could of all been avoided if the program could have seen the bored expression on a students face and a teacher could have changed it to prevent him from falling asleep. Or the confused look on a girls face, so the teacher could have come to help her instead of her asking for help from a friend who misinformed her. The computer program can take all the error out of emotion calculation, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect.""(5). We would become far more accurate as a whole group, eveyone learning in school could become more inteligent, and we would become happier people.

If the computer could detect a worried or sad emotion, the people around them could resolve the issue much faster and prevent anything bad from happrning. Our society as a whole would be far more advanced and left off better if we integrate this new advancemnt into our everyday lives. School could be turned into a place every student wants to go, and the success rate could also be increasing, with the new lessons and teaching styles being integrated for students.

F291,"Emotions are what you feel on a daily basis sometimes you can be happy and something you can be sad. In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" students from the University of Illinois collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. They developed better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can how how the student is feeling and it can help see if the student is enjoying what it is learning.

One facial expression can give it all away of how you are feeling. Facial Action Coding System can identify mixed emotions, each expression that is being made is compared to a neutal face that is not showing any emotional. If a student is having a bad day or something is wrong with them the software will instantly let them know how they are feeling. As in the painting ""Mona Lisa"" they were not sure what her emotions ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

Another reason it is valuable is it can help see if a student is enjoying what it is doing. For example in the passage it says ""A classroom computer coul recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If that were to happen it would be able to modify the lesson such a effective human intructor.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Examples of why it is vaulable are while a student is working on a lesson the computer can find out how a student is feeling and seeing if a student is enjoying what he or she is learning.

F293,"Mona Lisa has always been a very important 'lady' since we were in elementry, but who thought of her bringing an idea to mind when it comes to science? She is a piece of art, so why does this old painting become art? Well if we talk about the mastermind or understand what he is saying, then that may anwser some questions. It can also make us reconsider the technology that we have today.

According to a computer program mona Losa is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" In other words the Mona Lisa's intention was actually supposed to make you happy, but why does this make him want to start the program? Well he noticed the way that the computer was detecting her emotions and to began to wonder about science in computers.

The author learing about him then began to think of how it could be changed and what it could do. the author though

Maybe if you smile it could show the happy adds. If you were sad however, there could be diffrent adds as well. After thinking this over and over the author began to think of other things like how video games expressions could be more alive.

Then came the idea of how this could happen and what could be changed. The author mentions that it can't be easy for a PC to just go and reconize it off the bat, but if it were to be programed with basic steps then it might work. The author believes that this can make our everyday lives better, but how so? Knowing all of the stuff we went through, we still wonder how so. So then what better way to give an final example; ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student ios becoming confused or bored,"" Said the master mind of this idea.

In conclusion it is better to have a computer to help us create a emtion reading enviorment. It can help us in many ways and make the world more happy. This way would be so much better to show the way a mind works and help mpre scientist undrstand the brain. This can even lead to more dsicoveries that us human haven't reached yet and maybe make us a smarter country in return.       ","

F294,"The question is, is this technology valuable to telling what a student in a classroom is feeling? Can it actually tell how someone is feeling by their facial expression? I think, no. I mean what is the big deal here? They can't actually tell what a person is feeling, right? Well I for sure do not think so.

Of course you can look at someone and think they are sad by what they are saying or how they look, but they can obviously be acting like that to hide the fact that they are happy. Or the oppostie. Many, many people hide that they are sad with a big smile on their face. I just think this technology is pointless because people hide their emotions all the time. I know I do.

For example, say you are at a family get together, and you feel unhappy about something, but your mom wants to take a family photo. You're going to smile in the picture but that does not neccisarily mean you feel happy. Or for a school picture. You could be upset about something but of course you are not going to show that in a picture everyone is going to see. And why would you use the painting of Mona Lisa as an example. It is a painting! She might be smiling becasue that is how the artist wanted her to look but she doesn't feel that way!

""Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". Sounds like he knows his stuff, but does he really? I agree that he can tell if a person looks sad, happy, mad, disgusted, surprised, or scared, but is that how they're really feeling? I'd like to see them calculate how they actually feel. Until then, my opinion is that this is pointless.

""A renowned drama coach, Constanin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". Exactly, acting is all it takes. That sentence from the article pretty much proves my point. So overall, in my opinion, I think this is not valuable at all and it shouldn't be used in a classroom to see how a student feels. It won't work.         ","

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up.

If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the enviornment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do.

""[Essay Content: F295 / Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our enviornment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use.

F296,"The thought of driverless cars is amazing. Are there more dangers than what we think? If the car is supposed to alert the drive what happens if it fails to do so in enough time to stop the crash? If it is driverless your kids could start the car and leave they wouldnt need to even touch the wheel. Driverless cars are a great idea but the dangers and other factors have not been depated yet.

Just think it drives itself, your daughter wants to go somewhere and you wont take her. She could turn the car on and set a destination anywhere and the car would take her there. You lost your car to an eight year old who couldnt reach the pedals. Now if the car had to be driven by a person she wouldnt have been able to leave. Also if your sick and dizzy and you need to go to the hospital your car could take you there. If someone is injured and you have to help them while the car is moving thats another advantage.

Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel.

A teenager who DOES NOT know how to drive is supposed to steal a car for a gang as an initiation. He knows what the new driverless car looks like. Its the new car you just bout for 30 Thousand dollors. He brakes into the car and turns it on and sets the destination for the gangs warehouse. It drives itself there. He wouldnt have gotten the car there if it didnt drive itself.

What if the car doesnt stop at the lights and it causes an accident? Three people are injured two end up dieing. It could have been prevented if the driver of the driverless car was paying attention to the road. With the driverless car how many people do you really think will still pay attention to the road. This is a waste of taxe and government money. If we are going to use our money on something it should be to make gas cheaper, help veterans who are homeless, the wounded warriors who give us the freedom to spend money.

Driverless cars yes will change the world but i doubt it is for the better. Kids wont need to have drivers lisence if the car drives itself. How would we know that the vehicle is going to help us and not cause more wrecks.   ","

F298,"Today, many people all around the world rely too heavily on their cars.  There are many great reasons that car usage should be limited.  Car usage should be decreased because owning a car can be stressful, dangerous, and cars give off unwanted gas and pollution.  Although cars have been used for many years, it is not too late to take action on this problem.

Many people today would agree that buying and maintaining a car is very stressful.  It is very expensive to own a car, and it takes a lot of hard work to keep the car in good shape.  ""I am much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter (Rosenthal, 3).  Walter states that she is much happier without a car due to all the stress that comes with owning a car.  Walter also states that while she had a car, she was ""always tense,"" (Rosenthal, 3).  This is probably because of the expenses and time she had to sacrifice while trying to take good care of her vehicle.  This includes buying the car, paying for gas and insuance, repairs, and washing it.  People will save themselves a lot of time and money if the amount of car usage is limited.

Not only are cars are stressful to maintain, but they are also very dangerous to operate.  People run the risk of severe accidents every day when they drive their car.  In Source 4, the author states that new forms of public transportation will ""improve safety,"" (Rosenthal, 43).  The most occuring accidents are car accidents, which happen everyday.  Families will have to worry less about losing people they are close to.  There will be less unecessary accidents, such as drunk driving, and using phones while behind the wheel.  By reducing the amount of drivers on the road, the risk of these accidents will become much lower.

One last reason that car usage should be limited is that cars give off lots of unwanted gas and pollution into the air.  Recently, Paris faced ""near-record pollution,"" (Duffer, 10).  This was caused by the extreme amount of emissions from their cars.  The main cause for people wanting to reduce the use of cars is because of this unhealthy gas.  Cities all over the world are making efforts to help reduce and prevent the emissions.  The only way to do this is limit the usage of cars.  ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" (Rosenthal, 34).  If the change can be made, then it should, in order to keep the environment safe.  There isn't much time before the pollution gets out of hand.

Although so many people rely on cars so much, they do not see the advantages of not using them.  Most people don't put into consideration how harmful these vehicles are to the environment.  On top of that, they cause uneeded stress and danger.  Because of these reasons,  the usage of cars should be limited.

F299,"The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable from three reasons in the article that the author tells us by reading this article.

It's interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. In paragraph 3, the author says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.

The author tells in the text, ""We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."" But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look. It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.

From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how she's feeling and how she looks. There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture.

Moreover, the article gives us a lot of information of the advanced technological computer that constructs a 3-D model, to scan a human face and tell how the person feels emotionally. It's amazing and interesting to even read about Dr. Huang and Prof. Sebe ,his colleague, are both experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.","

F300,"In the article ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" the author

has explained and backed up his idea of studying Venus excellently. The author used clear facts of the harms and conditions that Venus has and why we can't just enter without protection. While the author was stating these facts he also was coming up with ideas of what NASA and other scientist are doing to better the chances of human beings going there and studying the Earth-like planet. The author continuously kept stating ideas of what human being could do to study Venus and not once said that we couldnt. The author was also very confident about his idea everytime he tought of one idea another one was on deck, just in-case one plan didnt seem so possible to humans.

In Paragraphs 1-5 the author is constantly stating facts of what Venus

is now and the harms and conditions that it has. Paragraph 3 it stated mostly why humans can't be there to live or just to study. Paragraph 3 stated for example,''on the planets surface, temperature average pver 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our planet.'' It also stated, that ''these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.'' He/She is baisically stating that the atmoshere and surface temp. is far more for a human to be there studying or living without ssome use of technology.

As the author states harms and conditions he/she also starts to

think of some ways us humans can build some technology of some sort to get us the information we need from the studyings of this planet. He/She started explaining an idea that NASA has compelled to try to get us over to the planet without being harmed. Paragraph 5 it stated,'' Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles abover the roiling venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.'' In that statement he/she explained that it would risky but survivable for humans.

As i stated in the first paragraph above the author started

using conclusions of how we were going to use the technology and what other idea NASA may come up with incase one plan went left. In paragraph 6 it stated, ''we only have a limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.'' this is where the author starts using methods of how the mission will be preformed because of some road blocks we'll run into. Paragraph 7 it stated, ''NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions.''

The author has done a fantastic job wit backing up his idea with

details, facts, road blocks and the way the missons should go. He/She did an amazingly, confident article of how us humans could study venus, if one plan went left he/she stated other plans NASA and other scientis are coming up with in the studying of Venus. The details in this article would surely help scientist out with procedure of studying Venus. I think the author did a fantastic job with supporting his idea of studying Venus. ","

He/She started explaining an idea that NASA has compelled to try to get us over to the planet without being harmed. Paragraph 5 it stated,'' Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles abover the roiling venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.'' In that statement he/she explained that it would risky but survivable for humans.

As i stated in the first paragraph above the author started

using conclusions of how we were going to use the technology and what other idea NASA may come up with incase one plan went left. In paragraph 6 it stated, ''we only have a limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.'' this is where the author starts using methods of how the mission will be preformed because of some road blocks we'll run into. Paragraph 7 it stated, ''NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions.''

The author has done a fantastic job wit backing up his idea with

details, facts, road blocks and the way the missons should go. He/She did an amazingly, confident article of how us humans could study venus, if one plan went left he/she stated other plans NASA and other scientis are coming up with in the studying of Venus. The details in this article would surely help scientist out with procedure of studying Venus. I think the author did a fantastic job with supporting his idea of studying Venus. ]""

F-M1,"Claim: This story is really about how many people studying about Mona Lisa and how the way his mood is.

Evidence: Lots of people try to figure out his history on his emotions. Someone uses a 3d computer and he figures out that he has 6 other emotions of himself.

Body: Some people perform an impressive calculation on his feelings by the look of his face.

F-M3,"The mona lisa first is the most best masterpiece the painting of centery. He did not want to smile for the camra and so he did not he had mixed emotions.This story is telling about the program on the computer that gave mona lisa a smile, because he could not smile, he did not want to. That was the case he did not want to smile, so they had to come up with a way to give his a smile. So they came up with a way and got his a smile for the photo and now he is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that he would just smile but he would not have it and so they had to give his a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want his smile so they made a program and copywrited his smile and made it fake. Like they said ""he was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. His emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci his emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then he would be missing on things on his face. As in the mouth and his chin,nose and cheeks part of his cheeks. Like they said he was a little upset and they did not know how to get his is good mood so thomas huang created the computer that can notic emotion like as in sadness,anger,happy,nervisness,fear,disguest.

F-M5,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, he looked like he was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how he is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions he was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating he was 100 percent happy, I mean he was being drawn which means he must have been one of the best looking men around or something was good about his and only his, and his face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around his that is causing his face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because he doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about his emotions are his lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims he is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. His eyes look like he is staring at someone, not dissapointed.","

F-M6,"I am against it. The people that show no emotion do it for a reason.

Most likely people show no emotion on their face becasue they don't want people to know how they feel. It gives people the hint saying i don't want to talk to you or just leave me alone.

Some students tend to be closed off from people and that's how they like it and want to be left alone. It's most likely the ones that don't show emotion had a bad past, something horrible happened recently and don't want people to find out, Etc. For example, a boy recently moved in with his father after 16 years living with his father. He wanted a new change so he left but what people don't know is that he cries at night for leaving his other siblings and father etc. He wouldn't want people to know how he really feels, so he hides it away showing no emotion or having a fake emotion on his face. He doesn't want anyone to know what's going on in his life or just doesn't want people in his buisness.

That is why we shouldn't use the new technology of indentifying emotions on people that obviously dont't want to. Not everybody is the same , has a good life like others or a bad one. Also, just because someone is bored the computer that can identify emotions shouldn't try to make the next thing they watch or do more fun for them. In the real world you go through things that is as boring as looking at a wall all day. So, they shouldn't get used to everything being fun because it's not.   ","

F-M8,"Imagine a man is late to work and his hair is a mess, he threw random clothees on, and all his work papers are stored in random places in his briefcase. But if he owns a driverless car, the man could sort out his paper files, fix his hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the mentleman in the story has a regular car, who knows if he will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that he will be, and he will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or he is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or he for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the man in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the man probably have gotten into a car crash because he was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the mentleman did have a driverless car, he would have been on time for work and he would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents.

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M8 / Imagine a man is late to work and his hair is a mess, he threw random clothees on, and all his work papers are stored in random places in his briefcase. But if he owns a driverless car, the man could sort out his paper files, fix his hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the mentleman in the story has a regular car, who knows if he will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that he will be, and he will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or he is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""

F-M9,"The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results.

In the first paragraph its states he is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because he is smiling, he couldve been fearful because he didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and he couldve been angery because at the time he wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint his facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face he made in the painting.

Based of the information they staed in the passage i do believe that the teachnology called Facial Action Coding System can identify human emotion.","

F-M10,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author gives many details about how many of the dangers Venus presents are unavoidable.

He also includes several details about how the dangers are life threatening to Earth dwellers.

Despite this, the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In paragraph three, the author presents the problem that Venus is too hot and has too much pressure for humans to be able to survive.

In paragraph five, he uses an example of a scientific organization's plan to counteract the heat and pressure.

He explains how NASA's plan to sends humans to study Venus in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so milles the roiling Venusian surface"" will counteract the heat and will relieve some of the pressure.

In doing so, he was able to provide a solution to two of the problems Venus presents to its explorers.

In paragraph 6, the author acknowledges the fact that ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground counditions.""

In the next paragraph, the author shows that NASA has been testing technology that will be able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus while being able to make calculations.

The author, once again, was able to present a problem and solve it, showing his readers that his original claim is supported.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was able to support his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

He was able to think of challenges that space explorers may face.

Then, he was able to counteract those problems with solutions.

He effectively made his case and supported it with details.","

F-M15,"I am against this new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System. It seems like it doesn't really work and they just make things up. I don't see how it could actually work like that. You can almost never what a person is feeling based on their facial expressions because some people have masks. You just can't say ""Oh this person looks really happy all the time"" Well maybe their not happy all the time. Maybe their not happy at all.

All we know is that he looks happy. Somewhat happy. It's not like he's around to tell you what he was feeling then. Maybe he was just trying to looks ugly for da Vinci because maybe he had a thing for his and he wasn't interested in an artist.

The text also states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Okay, I can probably agree to that. But still, computers that can calculate expressions seems a little futuristic to me. Maybe in 15-20 years that would be the coolest thing ever but right now, it just seems like people are trying too hard for a big new invention.

But as I start to look into life i start to understand that the most importanat things are sometimes the things that effect us the most, like for exmaple a car...

To begin with, in source 1, it states that passnger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car- intensive areas in the Untied State. It also states in source 4 that, Amercia passed peak driving. Now if us Americans could limit driving everday and pick up are bicycles now and then, I belive problems like tracffic jams, and car accidents would be less. I also belive that the air we breath would be much more better for us. In source 3, it says that millions of colombians hiked, skated or took buses to work and doing this lefted the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Mr. Goldberg, said in source 1 that, ""how much you drive is as important as wheather you have a hybird, I put this in my essay because I feel as if, Mr. goldberg is saying that cars are like a burrden and that sometimes putting then bown wont hurt. Like for example one time my father asked me to go out with his and i said yes, and as we are leaving the house i see that he lefted his car keys so I, took them for his and when we was out side i told his how are we supose to get in the car if you dont have your key? and he said "" we are walking"" I had a smile on my faces to know that my father was trying to make a biffrents.                ","

F-M17,"During our day and age vehicals are extremely common every where you look there is a vehical. Vehicals are the second largest producer of carbon emissions in America, right behind power plants From what the artical ""The End of Car Culture"".

Personal vehicals are not a nesesity there are many ways you can find your self going back and forth between locations even if it comes down to riding a bike. This world is all we got so why not treat it the best way we can and conserve it, you only get to live here once so make a differnce even if it is as small as picking a day out of the week to ride a bike to work or school. I personaly think the goverment should bput a ban on cars for certain days of the week and if people fail to follow that law their should be punishment not a small one either earth is the father of all life he protects us he nurishes us and takes care of us but yet we treat his like he is worthless. I know i wouldnt want anyone slapping my moher in the face and treating his like he is worthless so dont treat our father like he is not something worth saving!

Their are also other ways to ensure that we reduce carbon emmisons relased by tailpipes of cars for one cities could build cities closer together so when people want to travel the dont have to spend hundreds of dollars in gas that is slowly but surely distroying our home. People could use car polling or even turn their gas powered cars in for an hybrid that uses electricity to power the engine.    ","

F-M18,"I think that the use of technology to read the emotions of students in a classroom is valuable , because they can read how you feel as in if you are happy Susan can read how happy a person is , he can read if something is discusting to you as an example bugs , they are gross if Lola had seen a bug he would get sick to his stomach. Computers can also read if you are scared or angry If there was a painting hanging on a random wall he could read who made the panting, what brand of colors used, which type of paint brushes invested , he could even find out where the painting was created and or if robert was still alive . It's actuallyamazing how computers can even tell what state or city the painter was from and also about his colleauges he worked with. These computers can construct a 3-D computer model of the face too.","

F-M19,"In the artical "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" It talks about an intracit software that is able to detect the emotions of someone just by their facial exspression. For instance they used Mona Lisa, they were able to detect he was 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, and 2 percent angry. This software could be the begining of a whole new era. We could implament this into shools, webcams, security cameras and much more! We could use this to make more money and make people more happier in general.

I beleive if we evole this around a classroom atmostphere it could better the students of america. We could detect if a student isnt likeing a subjest, loving a subject, or just doesnt care. This program could work if we installed a camera in the fron of a classroom, Every student should be looking toward the front of the room anyways and should focus on the teacher. He could then look at the software on his computer and see if he needs to teach the material diffrently or with more inthusiasm

If he sees he is teaching something and most of the kids are unhappy, he could implement more activites change the tone of his voice, or even change the subject and come back onther day This software could be valuable for our future generation and make things easier to see what teachers need to change, or what the students should change. Overall this would benifit the shools of America and could make the educaion apect much more respectable.  ","

F-M21,"Using technology to read student,s emotional expressions some student's are bored some sleeping and some stressing doing the test but the others are happy and working in the test averyone has the percent of the emotional.

taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking his eyes cause i know his i and I know when he is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. He look happy but at the same time serious. His smile look like different he can't smile like us. The reson of that is now he is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason he doens't have the aye browns and thats why he sook serious. That is the reason he look like with different emotional feeling cause he don't have eye browns and he look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/his we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my husband feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional. For me the better option is the second one meet the people and ask some question to show the special boy or boys they are special for me and i want know more about him.

I like how the techonology work but we need to do the staff for us. ","

F-M23,"What would it be like to own a driverless car? Well as I sit here and ask myself that, I think of all the possible outcomes there could be. Yes, it would be nice to have a car that would do the driving for you, but humans will have to drive at some point. I feel as if this car could be resulted in both good and bad ways.

There are many reasons this car is a great idea. Say a husband and husband go out for a romantic date and leave their child at home with a babysitter. While they were gone, the child started running a fever and began to puke. The babysitter calls the parents but gets no answer. There is no medicine at the house and the nearest hospital is four blocks away. The boy babysitting does not yet have his license, so he asks himself what to do?

""[Essay Content: F-M23 / What would it be like to own a driverless car? Well as I sit here and ask myself that, I think of all the possible outcomes there could be. Yes, it would be nice to have a car that would do the driving for you, but humans will have to drive at some point. I feel as if this car could be resulted in both good and bad ways.

There are many reasons this car is a great idea. Say a husband and husband go out for a romantic date and leave their child at home with a babysitter. While they were gone, the child started running a fever and began to puke. The babysitter calls the parents but gets no answer. There is no medicine at the house and the nearest hospital is four blocks away. The boy babysitting does not yet have his license, so he asks himself what to do? He thinks about how long it would take to walk all the way there, then grabs the child and runs outside. Once he gets outside he puts the child in the car and straps him in. An even tho he does not have a license he gets in the driver seat, and starts up the car. He puts the car in gear and it beigns to drive itself to the hospital. Once they arrive at the hospital, the babysitter takes the child into the hospital and checks in while the car parks itself.

F-M26,"Why they invent Facial Action Coding System? Well in my personal opinion this is a good experiment for student, family, etc, because sometimes people do not want show they emotions or feeling, for example: If a boy of school that has depression or personal problems and he do not want talk abaut that with his teacher or consuler and this boy is thinking in kill himself, if the school have the Facial Action Coding System the professor can save his life, that a great experiment, but one thing is all school can't have it because are expense so this experiment can't help to all students or families that need.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, the Dr. Huang says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" he is trying to said that they experiment is not just for people, he is says that is universal so that mean is for all that have face or that the Facial Action Cording System can read emotions for example:The Facial Action can read the Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.

In conclusion the

Facial Action Coding System is a veryy good option for school they can saves lifes, and evit masacres of students with that Facial Action and be a major country. ","

F-M27,"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent man. we all kmow he was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked his if he was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show his emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up he would always say he was fine. he wiukd always bave a smile in the back of his head. but he knew no one would ever understand his so he never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling he always felt.

The three reasons about how to ¨Make Mona Lisa Smile¨ is facial expressions, emotions and 3-D computers.

What so wonder well know about Mona Lisa is his face. That is, hiding how he feels by putting on a fake smile. He shows tons of facial expressions to show people how he feels. Most of it is happines by 83 percent, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. Seeing the different characteristics that he has of facial muscle. While often shows vary of expressions that preforms a persons feelings. The reason Leonardo da Vinci´s painted Mona Lisa,he had studied human anatomy and convey speficc emotions.

Seeing that their are six basic emotions like happines, surprised, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Using those to associated every characteristic of the facial muscles and using them on Mona Lisa. With new software it can recongize Mona Lisa emotions. Which can actually calculate emotions of others.

An by now, knowing that we have new techonlogy like 3-D printers they can give Mona Lisa emotions.

The computer can construt a 3-D modle with all 44 muscles that must be moved like human muscles. The creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is by Dr. Paul Eckman. Which Computers can give the a certain look or emotion. The software stores similar anatomical information called electronic code. But only speacil computers can make people have emotions and faical features, not our normal PC at home.

The way people express their feelings and emotions, can show everyone how you feel about certain things. People who will try to hid their emotions are very fond of themselves for not expressing it.    ","

F-M30,"In the article of Making Mona Lisa Smile, we are introduce to a new technonology that is scanning our face or something that seems like it is scanning our face to indentify our emotions. As explain in the article it shows that they had used it on Mona Lisa to figure out how happy see seems or how disgusted he felt, or even how angry he is. In the first paragraph it talks out the percentage of his happiness,fearful,anger,disgusted. "" It shows that 83 percent he is happy, 9 percent he is disgusted, 6 percent that he is fearful, and 2 percent that he angry"". We may never know that this might of been true since the face they scaned was a drawing of his and he is no longer with us but we can say its ture for now. Computers now in days can give errors or even shut down, they can even restart if not used right or overheat. That can prove that what they scan can't be ture.

Yes it would be awesome to scan faces but is it even worth to pay? like we already know how we feel everyday why should we have a coding system that should code the wrong information and makes us seem like we wasted our time and money. A other problem would be is it even safe? how does the FACS even work? I wounldn't pay money just to get hurt or even have marks on my face just to see my emotion. In the article it says it can ""calulate our emotions like math homework"" that to me seem to be cool because the computer is thinking like us and it's doing its hardest to get the percentage of our emotion. I'll say that the FACS is a good idea just that they should keep on working with their idea and learn their mistake or errors and work on them to make this a good thing to use and sale.         ","

""[Essay Content: F-M30 / In the article of Making Mona Lisa Smile, we are introduce to a new technonology that is scanning our face or something that seems like it is scanning our face to indentify our emotions. As explain in the article it shows that they had used it on Mona Lisa to figure out how happy see seems or how disgusted he felt, or even how angry he is. In the first paragraph it talks out the percentage of his happiness,fearful,anger,disgusted. "" It shows that 83 percent he is happy, 9 percent he is disgusted, 6 percent that he is fearful, and 2 percent that he angry"". We may never know that this might of been true since the face they scaned was a drawing of his and he is no longer with us but we can say its ture for now. Computers now in days can give errors or even shut down, they can even restart if not used right or overheat. That can prove that what they scan can't be ture.

Yes it would be awesome to scan faces but is it even worth to pay? like we already know how we feel everyday why should we have a coding system that should code the wrong information and makes us seem like we wasted our time and money. A other problem would be is it even safe? how does the FACS even work? I wounldn't pay money just to get hurt or even have marks on my face just to see my emotion. In the article it says it can ""calulate our emotions like math homework"" that to me seem to be cool because the computer is thinking like us and it's doing its hardest to get the percentage of our emotion. I'll say that the FACS is a good idea just that they should keep on working with their idea and learn their mistake or errors and work on them to make this a good thing to use and sale.         ]""

F-M31,"My dream job was to become a scientist. I finally accomplished my goal, but it was a lot of hard work. Being a scientist is not an easy job! I had learned about ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" and now i have to interview with Mrs. Sally Backbone because he thinks the face was created by aliens when I beg to differ!

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because he thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens. I've did some research and i have all the answers to your questions Mrs. Backbone. Let's Get Started! "" Few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact and i think they are right"" said Mrs. Backbone. "" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and he was speechless.

Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions he needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook his head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen his roll his eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?""

Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all his questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told his he was wrong once again. He yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told his On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I also told his on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."" He asked me ''Was that all?'' Ms. Breadwill told Mrs. Backbone one last thing and it was "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Mrs. Backbone had all his questions answered, so I believe that my work here is done!

I am Ms. Breadwill,and I am a scientist at NASA. If you need questions answered about the Face on Mars, then I am the one to help you. I will answer all your questions whether they are easy or very difficult. I believe I am the best scientist in all America.","

F-M33,"Can people really show their emotions through a computer? How can this computer see our emotions?

For years people have problems with emotions or telling how their feeling, well not to long ago a man tested his emotions. This wasn't just any old test though, this man named Dr. Huang tested his emotions through a computer. Yes!!!, i said computer. Dr. Huang wanted to test a painting called Mona Lisa, (i'm sure you know of it or heard something about it. Well Dr. Huang tested his faced because he smiles a little and he seen that he's not just happy he has six different emotions all together. He 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How does this work? Well the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscels. Movement of one or two muscles is called an ""action unti."" Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surpried.

six different emotions one you and one computer, will you get tested?","

F-M35,"Self-driving cars are the future. No, this is not referencing futuristic tv shows and movies like Total Recall, Back to the Future, or Firefly. This is in reference to our actual future. Google has been testing, since 2009, the idea of self-driving cars. By 2020, these cars will soon become a reality. Us humans will soon be in the future. These cars will help our world so much. They will diminish the amount of crashes and lower pollution.

The reason why these cars are going to be so helpful is the fact that there will be less crashes. Humans are not perfect at anything. They have their flaws. Sometimes the best driver in the world crashes. This will all be solved with self-driving cars. A driver is drunk and forgot his phone and wallet at home. This person can't get an Uber or even call a taxi. Good thing though he has self-driving car. The car will do all the work, save for a few moments when the car is in need of a human. Here is another story. A man just texted his best friend a super embarrassing secret. He got into his car, started driving, and realized he forgot about telling his to not tell anyone. He cannot text now! If he looks down for even a split second, he will get hit. Not to worry though! With the self driving car, he can text his best friend and his secret is saved. These will also be two crashes that were avoided.

The other side of people in this argument have differemt opinions. They believe that self driving cars should not be a thing. They think they will cause more crashes and cause more accidents. These people also think it will be very boring to drive from now on, with the driver having to wait for his/his turn to take the wheel. These cars will be a danger to us humans.

This argument can be easily rebuttled for both reasons. One is that maybe the driver wants to relax and does not like driving. This will take the pressure off of him/his and they would only need to drive at certain points in time. Second off is that the car companies are working on it. As Dr. Werner Huber, a BMV project manager driver, says "" 'The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge... We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.' "" This shows that the people working on these self-driving cars are actually trying to make it so the drivers that will get bored, do not get bored. Finally, the last point is very much wrong. As earlier stated, drunk driving crashes and texting crashes will become lower. Also, the cars even cause less pollution. So, the people that want the same man-droven cars are actually killing more people by causing more crashes and pollution.

In conclusion, self-driving cars are the way to go. They will diminish the amount of crashes we experience per year, month, or even week. These cars will also help the environment as they procude zero pollution. So, if someone would rather want a car that is more likely to crash than a car that is more likely to keep you safe, people must ask them something. ""Really?""

F-M37,"Boy am I glad there's no more homework!

Hi, my name is Luke, I just finished high school and want to become a doctor.

I love the idea of helping people.

That's why I'm signing up to become a ""Seagoing Cowboy.""

A Seagoing Cowboy is a person that goes on a boat across all kinds of different oceans to help countries that were effected by World War Two.

Also, I would like to become a Seagoing Cowboy because I would like to be remebered in different countries for heroic actions.

Not very many people can be famous for their actions in different places because there's no way to spread the news.

The only people that really remember you are the people that you tell, or the people that you helped.

I think it would be cool to be known all around the world.

I also think it would be cool to travel around the globe to explore.

Most off all, I want my father to be proud of me, and I want to make history.

That is way I was super excited when I was accepted to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

I am going to be traveling around the world!

To me, that is a dream come true.

The only bad thing was, my father was not proud, in fact, he wasn't happy at all.

He thought becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would put me in danger, in danger?

I was helping people, how could that be dangerous, I thought to myself?

I was NOT giving up on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.

I just had to convince my dad, and the rest of my family, that helping other people wasn't as bad as they thought.

Also that I would be very careful on the boat so that I did not get hurt.

""Father,"" I called into the house I call home.

""Yes, Luke,"" called a sweet voice from the kitchen.

""I would like to talk to you about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.""

I was very nervous that I would not be able to convince my father about what I thought.

I wondered if I would even be able to convince his, or if I was wasting my time.

I was going overseas anyway, no matter what my father said, because this is my dream.

My father's voice broke me out of my thoughts.

""Oh, yes, I have been meaning to talk to you about that very topic."" I was glad that at least my father didn't seem angry with my actions.

""I just wanted to say that I will be very careful when I am overseas, and I promise that I will not get hurt in anyway possible."" I wanted my father to know that I wasn't lying any bit when I say that.

""I believe you, it is not you I do not trust.

It is that men that will be on the boat with you. You do not know any of them, or what their history is, how do you know if they are dangerous of not?""

""I just wanted you to know that I am going overseas tomorrow.""

The rest of the night was a blur, I told my dad why I wanted to do this so much, and eventually, he gave in.

He said that he supported me in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, and that he was always proud of me, only nervous.

I did go overseas the next morning, and enjoied it a lot.

I went to many places and saw many natural wonders.

Who knew how beautiful other places were.

A lot of places were very different than were I live.

Most of all, I was very glad that I got to help other people along the way.

In fact, I was very suprised how good it felt to know that I touched so many lives.

Oh, and did I mention that I have the record for how many trips one Seagoing Cowboy has done! I'm at eight right now, and I am thinking about going on one last trip before going home for good.

I can not wait to stay home and spend lots and lots of time with my family.

You wouldn't believe how long it has been since a have had some of my father's homemade pudding!

I can not wait to have some, and when I say father's homemade pudding, I mean homemade heaven!

Even though I have enjoied this experience very much, I will be glad to go home.

I have seen many cool creations.

For example, the Panama Canal, and I toured an excavated castle!

I've really be happy with the accomplishments I have overcome in the past few years.

I think my father would be very proud, I am proud as well.","

F-M38,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe he never talk about how he felt when the picture was took and people just say he was happy and he wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

F-M39,"Luke is trying to get other people/friends to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

He asks his brother John to join.

""It's a lot of fun,"" I said.

""You get to explore and go around the world to see places that you've never seen before.

The best part is that you get to go and help others who don't have a lot of supplies.""

""I don't know."" says John quietly.

""I just don't want to be away from home, and something bad could happen to Dad and Dad.

I'm just not sure about this one,"" says John.

""You're just not willing enough to help others in need.

Who am I kidding.

You would never want to actually go exploring with your brother.

You would never want to leave your job for awhile.

You juat can't handle it.""

I just don't want something bad to happen while I'm gone.

You never know what could happen.

I can give you an answer.""

John is silent.

You will need help around the house, and you'll probably miss me.""

""John, your 18.

You can leave your dad and I, I promise you that we will be okay.

We have eachother, and we have our wonderful neighbors to help us with any task."" Replies Dad.

""I told John that it is a trip of a lifetime,"" I exclaimed.

You will never forget the moments that we have together.

If you come with me, it will make me feel stronger.

I'll have you by my side the whole time.

We can help others in need together.

John, just please agree and come join me for this one.

F-M42,"Have you ever wanted to help animals cross the Atlantic Ocean? That's what Luke Bomberger was. Luke Bomberger was a Sea Cowboy that helped animals cross thje Atlantic Ocean. I have two reasons why you should join the program.

The first reason is that if you care about animals this is the right job for you because, at this job you have to take care of them by feeding and cleaning. The animals you will be taking care of are horses, young bulls, and mules that are shipped over sea. The second reason is that if you want to be a cowboy, this is the right job for you because, you are dealing with bulls, horses, and mules like every cowboy or boy.

Other people might have an argument about it. They might say that it's boring and stupid but, it's really not boring or stupid. It would be really fun if you wanted to be a cowboy or cowboy, and liked animals","

""[Essay Content: F-M42 / Have you ever wanted to help animals cross the Atlantic Ocean? That's what Luke Bomberger was. Luke Bomberger was a Sea Cowboy that helped animals cross thje Atlantic Ocean. I have two reasons why you should join the program.

The first reason is that if you care about animals this is the right job for you because, at this job you have to take care of them by feeding and cleaning. The animals you will be taking care of are horses, young bulls, and mules that are shipped over sea. The second reason is that if you want to be a cowboy, this is the right job for you because, you are dealing with bulls, horses, and mules like every cowboy or boy.

Other people might have an argument about it. They might say that it's boring and stupid but, it's really not boring or stupid. It would be really fun if you wanted to be a cowboy or cowboy, and liked animals]""

F-M43,"Have you ever wanted to know if you can tell if someone is forcing a smile or a real smile? I agree with the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. By using this technology you can tell how your friends, parents, and even teachers are feeling.

To begin with, You wake up for school and your dad is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how he was feeling. When you come in the room he would erase ""that"" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how he was feeling and do something to make his feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug his and tell his to go back to sleep, then you go to school.

In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as ""energized"" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say ""nothing"" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.

Last but not least, according to the article ""we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his face"". Using the technology of FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.

Inconclusion, FACS is a technology that allows you to read people feelings and mood. What if your friend is feeling depressed and dont want to live anymore? With FACS you can help them and prevent suicide. FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.","

F-M44,"Venus our brother planet, with his surface being the harshes of the other planets and his breathtaking carbon dioxide atmosphere that takes up 97%. Venus been looked at for years as the next planet to visit,as so is Mars but lets talk to his yet,Venus has been studied to know that their had been life on his before and what causes the carbon dioxide and what forces the planet to keep its posure. Venus is a really complicated planet and the thought of visiting could be harmful.

As in the 1800s devices where invisioned but not in that way,since World War 2 computers were first looked at in 1940s and the technology they had back them was even close to compare to modern day,as they were slow to load and ares was fast to load .

But think even with modern day technology,we do still fail to communicate so what if we try to vist Venus and then the connection with the commanding officer is lost and now your space floating and that their is a real danger.

So maybe going to venus is not bad idea but its an idea that won't happen but who knows, lets not see whose survives the longest.

But my conclution is why does Venus have to be the go to planet, despite all the carbon dioxide and his 800 degrees Fahrenheit. I know why we picked Venus becaouse it's the exact size of us and the 2nd closes to the sun.","

F-M46,"What's your opinion on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)? If people used this system, it wouldn't be right. This might seem like a good and helpful system but if we start using it, it'll more likely upset people because not everyone is comfortable with others knowing their emotions, if everyone knows others emotions then we won't have to communicate as much because we have a machine that'll tell us, and jobs will be taken away because we will no longer need them.

Yes, this system would be quite interesting, but many people wouldn't agree with always having others know how they're feeling. They want to keep to theirselves and just think their emotions through, they shouldn't have to share them if they don't want to. In the passage, it says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his face."" At this point, you'd ask if he is okay. If he doesn't want you to know then he won't tell you so he shouldn't have to. If he does want to talk about it or tell you how he's feeling then he will. The person should always have an option as to whether or not people figure out how they're feeling.

Imagine the person next to you, in this case a boy, is sitting there just staring off into space, you would probably ask them what he is thinking about. If we use this system, then we won't have to ask because we'll already know if he's angry. If you already know he's angry then you wouldn't go up and talk to his, meaning we'd lose communication and that person would lose someone to talk to his emotions about (if he wanted to). In the article, it says, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" This shows that the computer will be able to detect the emotion that person is feeling so you won't have to.

In society today, we shouldn't use this system. Maybe if it was back in the day then it would be more beneficial because we didn't have as many therapists to help but now we have occupations that help us figure out how and why we're feeling certain emotions. As an example, imagine yourself as a therapist. If you're a therapist, you'd have multiple patients coming in your room on a regular basis to talk about how they're feeling, how their day was, etc. and you'd help them figure out why they're feeling happy, depressed, sad, angry, etc. The next day you look on the news and there's a new kind of computer that tells you how you're feeling, but that's your job. When you go into work, only half of your usual patients come in and the next day, the amount splits in half again. Sooner or later, you're down to very few patients but you aren't getting paid enough anymore so you have to quit and find another occupation. This is what would happen to many therapists and occupations similar because the people have a different way of seeing their emotions now.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is not a good idea. This system would make society more anti-social. We should work on finding more ways for people to come together and communicate with each other and this would do the opposite. It would make the people who do not want everyone to know their emotions upset/angry, it would make us lose communication, and some of our occupations would be lost. Those are some examples of how the FACS is not very beneficial.","

F-M47,"Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or he painted on the canvis. They could be happy, sad, surprise, angery, disgusted,and afraid. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a good thing, because not only students can the device but middle age people can use the device too.

paragraph 1 said ""He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."";and how we know that? you may ask. The FACS ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS"" wizard was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit.

Paragraph 4 said ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" and that means every you move your expressions change. They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly. They can move and mix emotions in da vinci's masterpiece wizard the Mona Lisa useing the FACS. Dr. Huang's new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code.

So lets say you was trying to see all of your dad's emotions in one picture, by useing FACS you can move rotate and mix emotions to figer out your dad emotions, and to have students and teacher do that thats cool. So yes, its valuable.           ","

As Sally was aproaching the stage of the news studio there was bunches of people in the audience waiting to hear the truth, but Sally was sure most of these people weren't going to hear what they want to hear because a lot of people are wrong with their opinions to this subject.

As the show begun the news reporter Ted Cruze asked the question everyone was waiting for, ""Are those pictures from Mars signs that aliens were there and left those misterious faces?"" Everyone was in gradual shock ready to hear the truth.

As Sally started to speak he started off talking about how people may think that aliens were the reasons we found these sightings on Mars. For years that is just what people believe, they think aliens were the reason for those faces but from what NASA has to say about it, all these people are wrong.

Most people don't even believe in aliens but if half of their state or city is saying that of course those people will go with the flow. But with the scientific reaserch NASA has done majority of these people are wrong! As the show continued on the crowd was going wild and Ted was shocked himself at was Sally was announcing out about the rare face. People were screaming and being argumentive because so far they are all just completly wrong on what they have been believing. As the show was winding down to the very end there was a quesion from the audience asking Sally how he even knew all this stuff and if it was even true. Sally's response was that everything he knows has been discovered by his and the other workers at NASA, they have all been very curious of what is going on as well as everyone else and so they have been trying their best to do their job and get the truth! Sally finished the news show making sure everyone knew the truth and to make sure he arugued his case. He also made sure that eveyone new that this misterious face was not left from aliens that it was infact just a natural landform we have captured on camera and that his information was very well certified because of course he works with NASA and they all know what their doing!","

F-M49,"The use of this technology is not valuable for a studdent in a class because some emotions are to be kept because with this technology students emotions will be out there for people to wonder what is happening with the child.Well how about the child do not want other people to know what is happening in his or his life or with his or his emotions.In the artical it states that the computer could recognize when the student is beccoming confused or bored, My question is how will the teacher know when he is teaching the children, and how will he know that one of his students is confused, it also stated that it could modify the lesson like a human instructor and that would be taking jobs from teachers . One of my questions is that if the computer knows what you are feeling and if it says that you are bored and the computer will modify to like a human instructor will it spice things up and make lessons funner and interesting so kids won't get bored?Im againt using this technology for it to read the students emotions because some emotions are to be kept and it is creepy for a computer to be reading your emotions that maybe you didn't know you were feeling.","

F-M50,"The new Facial Action Coding System cannot be very accurate due to humans being able to hide emotions quite easily. As it says in the beginning statement, ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" Thus meaning this software is not one-hundred perect reliable. Human beings can hide emotions without even trying. It is impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.

In many movies actors act amd perform in different emotions everyday. Think about how an actor can use deception to trick the watcher into thinking they are upset and angry in the movie. Behind thr scenes the actor could be hystrically laughing but we dont see that, we only see the acting part. Therefor it is impossible for human beings to be able to detect someones true emotions, not even an advanced computer application can do so.

In paragraph 2 a statement catches the eye by saying, ""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotionslike math homework?"" First off the human body is not a calculation, it is a living creature that has feelings and emotions. You dont just calculate the emotions to find them out. To find emotions you get emotionally attatched to someome or get close to them by talking to thrm amd they will vent to you and find out what is going on, either if thry are happy or sad.

In the writing it talks about Mona Lisa,and how he was feeling during that moment. Many may say you can do this and find out how he was feeling, but others will say it is impossible to find his emotions. Those others would also say to find his true emotions you would have to ask his, in which you can no longer do because he and the artist are deceased. No one will trully know how he felt durung this time, unless he states his feelings somewhere.

In paragraph 6 it states that,""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad."" It later on states thag only looking into the webcam it could detect your emotions. Not only could it really not detect your emotions, it would make people feel unsafe because they are constantly being watched looking for a face to read. The Facial Action Coding System cannot read someones true emotions. The program may predict amd see what the individual is feeling, but it is trully impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.","

F-M53,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is simply about Venus and why we should explore it, even though it has many dangers. The author definetley has good evidence to support his or his claim, but I do believe that he or he strays from the main idea of the question throughout the article.

The author does not support this idea enough. As I read throughout the story, I only noticed about one paragragh that was actually explainging why we should explore Venus. According to the prompt, the author is being evaluated on how well he or he supports that claim. I did not see enough support through the whole story. When the author did support the idea though he or he had very good evidence. According to the the article the reason we should explore Venus is because it is the closest planet like ours. I think that the author should go more in depth and explain how and why that is, so that he or he can really pull us in.

Next is that even though the author didn't show a lot of support in why we should explore Venus, he or he did have good evidence on how we would. Most of the story was the author explaining different ways of how we could possibly explore Venus safely. For example, the author explained how NASA has been working on other approaches to study Venus. Like, special electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus like conditions and the electronic lasted for three weeks. If the author has good support like this, he or he should most importantly discuss more of why Venus should be explored to spike our interest more in knowing how to do so.

To conclude, the author doesn't support the claim of studying Venus enough. He or he should include more details as of why we would want to study Venus. The author has great support and detail, they just need more evidence to back up those ways of studying the planet. I believe people would have great interest in studying Venus if the author just explained why we should a little bit more.           ","

F-M54,"I am against driverless cars, because it could dangerous. Like it said in paragraph eight ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting on their turn to drive?"" The answer is yes the driver would get bored. Once the driver got bored he or he could potentally take their eyes off of the road. If he or he did take his or his eyes off of the road and the car didn't detect something that needed to be handled by the actual driver things could become extreamly dangerous.

Another thing that could be potentally dangerous is what if the driverless car malfunctions and the actual driver didn't know? In the passage in paragraph two it says ""google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" It also says "" their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" Although they haven't had a crash yet it could happen. And when it does happen who is to blame?

In paragraph nine there is a really good question. It says "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If you were to answer the question of who is at fault many would say the driver is at fault, but others would say that the manufacturer is at fault in this situation. In my opion both would be at fault. Why you may ask, because it was both of their faults. The manufacturer might not have checked everything before he or he sent it off to be bought. The driver is at fault here too because he or he might not have been paying attention to his or his surroundings. In the passage in many paragraphs it says that the driver could take control. If the driver was paying attention he or he could have possibly prevented the accident. In colclusion that is why I am against dreverless cars.","

F-M55,"Leonardo Da Vinci's renaissance painting ""Mona Lisa"" is one of the famous painting this world has ever known. But there was one question in my mind,""WHAT IS HIS EMOTION""? Is he smiling, is he angry, is he sad, what is his emotion.

Now this new technology called FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) can measure human emotions. It also measures Mona Lisa's emotion. Is it valuable in today's world.

Nowdays, unlimited machines have been built to comfort human civilization. Some of them really benefitted, some of not. Now a Human emotion telling machine is built to measure emotions. I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, ""IT IS USELESS"". WHY?.Let me explain you.

Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days.

I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make. Useless because it has no role to deal with human stress, it reads emotions, that's pretty cool. But what anout dealing with stress. I hope you like my thought.   ","

F-M57,"The technology emotional expression is helpful because now that we have that we can look back at old pictures and wonder. What was Abraham so mad about? Or why was George Washington so happy but sad about? This experiment can change the way we look at history.

This experiment can help us more understand the past. Like the Mona Lisa nobody knew he had all that emotion in his when he took that picture. Because his smile was so big it stood out. When really he was happy but had all these other emotions in his that we didn't know he had.

This can help students by doing projects on the person they picked and they can research a pciture and then use the experiment to discover their emotions at the time. This new experiment can change alot of wrong discovers that were made in the past. Now we can know more with the new emotional expressions.

It can also be used to tell if some one is lying or telling the truth. It's so many celebrities that put on a fake smile to the press when really there's something going on behind closed doors. This new thing can help people that have problems because we can see how they really feel. Say if we used this in the school year book and we use it on a student that does abd in school or is always in trouble. we could actually look at the emotional expression and see that he has a lot of anger in him and could cause harm.

I'm glad that this was made cause it can make a lot of change. It can help in schools, businesses, police departments, etc. It's a lot of people out here that put on a fake smile but would really go and shoot up a school or could commit suicide. But now that we have this we can stop thought incidents from happeing. ","

F-M58,"Have you ever heard of a driverless car? Not many people have in this day in age because it hasnt been a hot topic in the many years people have been trying to achieve this task.

My position on driverless cars has me very intersted in the near future of where this invention might go. My opinion of driverless cars is amazing, it could help with fuel saveing and aslo passenger safety for many people on the road. Also it would change the face of todays technology skale amazingly. The technological advances for driving cars will esculate over time and maybe even introduce the floating car.

The safety of passengers would increase dromatically becuse there will not be many accidents around the world. There are people driving drunk, or under the influence of other substances. Self driving cars would also help people that cannot drive because they have a medical condition that prevents them from useing car transportation. Self driving cars would help those people over come those obsticals in there life and give them the transortation they need to do the tasks they need to overcome such as doc. apointments.

Self driving cars would help fix many intrasting situations that causes problems in today society. From saveing lives to help the need to get to point A to point B with no struggle and not much effort to do so. I am inroduced to the struggle every day with my father. He has a dissability called muscular skurosis (M.S.) with affects his brain and his muscles so he is not able to drive. The self driving car will help with that problem and will giver his the option to leave the house and go do what he needs to do

My conclusion is that self driving cars, or asisting cars would help change the driving world and save many lives from people who drive destuctively and help people have transportation to get where they need to go.","

It could help a lot with fathers on the go with a lot of kids, the simple fact of a major improvments on cars for the future, and people that like to text and drive or put on make up while driving.

The driverless car concept could help a lot in the future.

It would help those fathers that need to turn around or reach back to give there child something while he is driving. It would help because he could just put it into driverless mode and do what he needed to do.

It would be a major help for those people that happen to text and drive, or put on make up while driving.

The driver could then put the car into driverless mode, and send that last text or finish their make up before work, and prevent them from crashing.

The overall concept of driverless cars is a big acomplishment and could bring us closer to bigger, and better things for cars in the future.

The concept of driverless cars is far from being a every day thing, like it says in paragraph 10.

For the most part he is happy you can tell he is happy becaus ehshe is smilling in the picture. What you can not see is the other emtions such as disgust or fear or angry. So how can the author really say that he is all those things if he. although it could be a fake smile you never know. That is like everyday life a person could look happy but really be sad or mad about something you never really know how a person is feeling unless they personally tell you. Facial expression are a big part of our world. As the author states, ""Even though indivulas often show varying degress of expression for example not smiling broadly.""

What I stated in my paragraph befor was that you may tell somebody that your really close with you feelings but then be smiling or not showing any emtion at all. The author states it later in the article. He states "" you can probalby tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his face."" Us as humans have a hard time showing emotion or descrinbing our emtions . Although this painting is meant to bring a smile to your face it shows how much technolgy plays a big part in this as well.

F-M61,"Computer technology is evolig every year and its begining to change the way the clssrooms are held as well. From books to computers, emails, grading systems etc. Recently there has been something else in place in schools too. Facial Action Coding System, which enalbes computers to identify human emotions. In schools the computer can scan your facial expressions and make the activity your doing more intresting.

There are universal signs of emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprised, and disgust. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. They tested this on the Mona Lisa and it could detect his mood in the painting. It calculated that his facres was showing 4 different moods just by his face. Imagine what it can do for schools in the world.

I believe it is a great idesa to have these software emotion-recognition in schools because it can give students a better way to learn. If the computer can see that a student is annoyed by what they are doing it changes the way the activity is going to get the students more interested in what they are learning. The more the student gets interested the more that he/he learns just by actually paying attention. The computer can also help make grading easier as well. When a teacher is grading the computer can see that he/he is surprised at all the grades in the system.            ","

F-M63,"Imagine a student is doing a digital activity in class on a computer and he is bored out of his mind. His head starts to nod forward and it becomes harder for his to keep his eyes open. Suddenly the screen changes all on it's own and gives his a different, more interactive problem to tackle. Feeling intrigued and more awake, he starts to work again. This method of engaging students could be made possible with the use of the Facial Action Coding System.

It's a technology that detects human emotions by reading them using all 44 of the major muscles in the face. It then calculates the emotion by associating the movement of the muscle with a specific emotion. This could be useful in classrooms because of it's ability to read student's facial expressions and then calculate their emotions.

Although you'd be able to read the faces of students who are excited or engaged, this technology would be more useful on the other end of the spectrum. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could be used to help point out which students are bored, tired, or struggling. Adjustments could be made to learning plans and lessons in order to more effectively engage students of all ages and types, and help them learn better.

In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, one of the main developers of this technology, Dr. Huang, further explains how this could be useful in classroms, as well as other aspects of life. He states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 1). This could greatly increase a student's ability to learn.

While it might seem that this technology wouldn't make a great impact on education systems, it could significantly improve the learning environment in a classroom. The technology can effectively engage all students in a new and advanced manner, using something everyone has - facial muscles.                ","

F-M64,"Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.

Based on the text evidence,

"" Making Mona Liza Smile,""

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. He could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use he is 83% happy.

Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that he shows no expressions, he is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet he's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M64 / Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.

Based on the text evidence,

"" Making Mona Liza Smile,""

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. He could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use he is 83% happy.

Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that he shows no expressions, he is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet he's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

F-M66,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author is describing a new technology, one that enables computers to identify human emotions. This could be valuable in the classroom for both a student and a teacher. Many teachers can find a hard time to deal with students because of things that could be going on at home. Teachers can find it hard to also help students if they don't know how they are feeling. Facial Action Coding system can help those teachers understand what a student is feeling.

For example, Sarah has a lot of family issues going on at home. He comes to school, doesn't feel like doing his work and his teacher want's to help his but doesn't know how to approach his. This technology can help the teacher get a better understanding on what Sarah is feeling and even ask his why he feels that certain emotion. This can build up a good relationship between a student and a teacher. A lot of students don't have good relationships with teachers because some teachers could say the wrong thing which leads to the student not wanting to say anything.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states that ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this also could a help a teacher to know what type of assignments or projects that he/he could give to the class so the students wouldnt be bored or confused. This could also give insight to the teacher on what he/he feels like they should do better in there lectures or what their teaching to the class.

In my personal expierence, I knew a lot of teachers who didn't know how to approach me because they either didn't know what to say or how to say the right thing. If my teachers had this type of technology built into the school computers and could see through their computer how student's and myself were feeling. I would have a much better relationship with most of my teachers because they would have known what I'm feeling, whether i'm feeling sad or angry.

In my conclusion, the Facial Acting Coding System would be valuable of students in a classroom because it could both help students and a teacher to be able to build a strong, trusting relationship and also giving insight to one another. This could help thousands of teachers worldwide on how they could help there students and also have a understanding on what they could change or learn in their classroom from a students facial expression.

F-M67,"There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.

To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a man is happier and the loss of his car has changed his life for the better. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" he says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The man proves that his life has changed because he doesn't have to go through that anymore. His car-less life is the one that makes his happy.

Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, ""If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.

Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.

The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.                       ","

F-M69,"Imagine a man is in labor, sweating profusely as his water breaks and contractions begin to happen. His husband is off at work, and he is home alone. Who will drive his to the hospital in this emergency situation? Oh wait, he purchased a driverless Google Car last week. This car will drive his to the hospital, possibly saving a life. Driverless cars are an innovative new idea, and this idea needs to be taken to the streets and incorporated into the life of an everday human.

Driverless cars are an an ingenius invention. Driverless cars bring many great aspects to the table. These asepcts include half the fuel usage of today's taxis, more safety features, and the convience of not having to drive. In paragraph one, the article sates, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus."" This exerpt from the passage shows that these cars would be much less stressful than taking a bus, and would use half the fuel.

Many people believe there would be too many legal issues with driverless cars. If the car were to malfunction and crash, who would be at fault? In paragragh nine, the passage states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" These lines from the passage leave the open question of whose fault it would be in the case of an accident.

The legal issue is a large problem, but it has an easy answer. In paragraph 7, the passage states, "" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This exerpt from the passage shows that while the car is driving itself, the driver should still be paying attention. The manufacturers should make it clear that there is a risk of an accident, but it will be the drivers fault in that case. The driver has a decision to make, they can sit back, or they can pay attention.

The positive factors heavily outweigh the negative factors of having driverless cars. While the legal problem is still in the air, it can be fixed easily. So think back to the pregnant mentleman. What would be if it was not for the driverless car? ","

F-M72,"All humans have emotional expressions. Emotional expressions can be detect by other humans that are in his/or his life. Any kind of technology cannot really tell what his/his expression is. Humans can detect other peoples emotional expressions, but computers cannot detect it. It depends on if the technology is working or not.

In the passage, the author is explaining how a professor has some sort of technology that can detect a male or males emotional expressions. Technology is not a good way to tell a person's expression, because technolgy can lie to a person's face, but it can always work. The author said, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do""(D'Alto Paragraph 6). The author is promoting that a computer is a better way to detect a human's expression.

Computers can lie to someone about his/his emotional expressions, but the computer can always tell the truth. The author mentioned, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr, Huang preicts""(D'Alto Paragraph 6). Technology can either detect or not dectect human's emotional expressions.

Humans can other people's emotional expressions, but computers cannot detect his/his expressions. It depends on if the technology is working or not.

F-M74,"I do not think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable when using it to read students' emotions. I have many reasons why I am against this new technology. I believe that unless a person wants to share his or his emotions then nobody else has any business knowing what that person is feeling. My three main reasons why I am against this are because some people hide their emotions because they don't want other people to know about them, emotions are personal, and this new technology will invade the privacy of people.

Fist of all, I will be talking about my first reason that I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I am against it because some people hide their emotions so that way other people don't see them. Many people in the world like to keep their emotions to themselves. They do not like others to know how they feel, but with the new software it will be almost impossible for people to keep the emotions to themselves. In the caption underneath the picture of Mona Lisa, there is a sentence that says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" That sentence explains that this new software will be able to tell exactly how a person feels. No matter how hard the person is trying to hide their feelings they will no longer be able to fool anyone because of the Facial Action Coding System.

Second of all, I will talk about my second reason why I am against this new software. The second reason why I am against this software is because emotions are personal. They are not to be put out in the open all the time. When someone is experiencing negative emotions he or he may want to keep those personal feelings private. Paragraph 7 and 8 state that the face uses different muscles when fake smiling and real smiling. If a person is not happy and uses a fake smile then he/he is most likely indicating that he/he does not want to share his/his emotions with another individual. This software can detect which musles in the mouth are being used when smiling. This means that fake smiles will no longer fool someone who uses this software.

Last of all, I will be taking about my final reason that I am against this technology. This technology is an invasion of privacy towards people. The caption underneath the picture states that this software can detect exactly how a person is feeling. Imagine if this techonolgy was used on a student who had a lot a personal and private things going on in his/his life that made him/his not want to talk about his/his emotions, but then comes along a new software that can detect the emotions of a person. If this is used on that student then that student's private and personal emotions were just uncovered. What if that student didn't want people to know? It's too late now and that student feels worse because he or he did not want them to be known. Emotions and feelings will be detected without that person's consent too.

In my opinion, this new technology is not valuable when it is used to read the emotions of students in a classroom setting. I do not think that it should ever be used on a student, child, or even an adult. If a person feels that he/he wants to share the emotions he/he is feeling then he/he will tell someone. All and all I 100% disagree with this new software.                   ","

F-M77,"By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring. This would be the first time anyone has done something that like. But the results could vary cause of how the students are feeling.

Say there is a boy who is having a really good day, he got asked to Prom and he said yes. It made his day and he was happy for the rest of the day. And then take a boy who was late for the bus and had to walk to school. He would be tired and upset. They both have two different emotions, so the results would be different.

Read this part of the article, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". If a classroom did a scan and all the students were tired, not interested, and ready to go home, the teacher could take those results and make the class more interesring for the students. The students would probably have more fun and want to do the work if the teacher made it fun and interesting for the students. But don't make it too difficult for the students cause they could shut down again.

By doing the Facial Action Coding, the result could be different for some students. But it would be fun and interesting to switch things up a bit and have while learning. By doing the Facial Action Coding, you can see how the students really feel. And it cpuld help them and you (the teacher) get a better understanding of how to teach.","

F-M78,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is shown that this high tech software can recognize how you are feeling for example if you smile a scanner will send the data to the computer and the main thing that the computer has to know is the mucles you are using because you could actually be mad,sad,disgust,fear,and surprise all at once so this high tech computer sees if you are using zygomatic major then you are smiling but if the person is frowning then that means that they are sad.

The Mona Lisa one of the most known peice of art from the Renaissance area made by Leonardo Da Vinci's is said to be the only painting at that time that seems to be a man smiing but that is false. The Mona Lisa was actually showing more then just a smile he was showing three more different emotion besides happyness. The reason that is because when they took a picture of his and put his face in 3D humans face it showed that he was disgusted,fearful,and angry. So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not.

""[Essay Content: F-M78 / The Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is shown that this high tech software can recognize how you are feeling for example if you smile a scanner will send the data to the computer and the main thing that the computer has to know is the mucles you are using because you could actually be mad,sad,disgust,fear,and surprise all at once so this high tech computer sees if you are using zygomatic major then you are smiling but if the person is frowning then that means that they are sad.

The Mona Lisa one of the most known peice of art from the Renaissance area made by Leonardo Da Vinci's is said to be the only painting at that time that seems to be a man smiing but that is false. The Mona Lisa was actually showing more then just a smile he was showing three more different emotion besides happyness. The reason that is because when they took a picture of his and put his face in 3D humans face it showed that he was disgusted,fearful,and angry. So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. In my conclusion emotion can be easy to find threw high tech software but we as human can see the person emotions to but the only differents is that we see the main picture and not the littlest one's.]""

F-M79,"The Mona Lisa painting is hard to tell what his emotions are ,but that's why there's science. They can figure out your emotions by looking at your muscles in your face or just by looking at how your eye brows are place or your mouth is placed. They have

computers that can see faces off of paintings emotion. All they have to do is make a 3-D model and make the same frown as Mona Lisa to tell what his emotions are. The students expressions are most likely to be happy and amazed

because a computer can do all of this. The students must want to try this on their emotions to see if it works.

The students must think

the computer does everything , they want to know

their emotions even though they know

their emotions

because they are thinking

about it in their brain. Just like the Mona Lisa painting they said that was his

happy face because he has 83 percent happyness in his emotions. You can have more then one emotion in your

face. They just have to see the muscles in your face and see how they are placed. It is a cool thing that they can do this so if someone can't talk they can check there emotion to see if their sad ,hurt , or happy.

That is really a good thing also doctors can use this to use on a unhealthy person to see how there feeling because not everyone want's to let everyone know their emotion.

They can do this on animals even they would have to do a 3-D model of it. This must of took a lot of scietists to do this because they could get lots of money for this. Science can do alot of things dealing with muscles and body movement. This knows how you are feeling because your movement in your body. The students must think that there is a other man using the technology to this ,but it's the computer.

They have to use the computer to get the 3-D models out then the scientists use their brains to figure where the muscles go.

The last thing is scientists may want to use this on children at school because it is a fun thing for the kids and it can give them more feed back on more emotions and how they look on students faces. That will help them out with maybe more emotions on certain people they can use it on more painting. They used it on the Mona Lisa becasue you can't tell his feeling because he has no movement and he's not smiling in his drawing. The students like this because it is a cool thing to look at and see it's emotion because it's its a drawing ,but with alot of details.","

F-M80,"Would you rather walk or drive a car going to work?

it would be much more easier to drive a car, right? In today's generation people use their car for transportation going to work or just driving around. All their going to do is pay more gas and spend more,but gas today is more expensive than years ago. Many people need to realize that their are to wasting gas and it can create more traffic jams because many people need to get to their destination on time or not on time. The fellow citizens needs to have an advantage of limiting car usage.

To begin with, Car can create more gas usage because many people just go to shorter destination or longer destination. But the things is that people just waste gas because they dont realized how they are spending a lot of money. For example, a boy is going to the store closer to home, he is thinking if he going to drive his car or walk and he is thinking to drive his car, why? because he would rather not walk or he is to lazy. The boy is wasting his gas. In today's society many people need to open their eyes and realized thing on how much they are spending on car usage.

According to this source 3: ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in

Bagota"", "" Bogota, Columbia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jam (paragraph 20)"". This quote states that many of the Colombians are supporting their country car usage. They would rather hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work. Also, it cannot lead to traffic jams. The fellow citizens need to look over what many people are trying to do to limit their car usage because other people cannot afford buying a car. For example,  many years ago only people who are wealthy can only afford cars and those who cannot afford it, they would make an effort to make things as possible to get in their destination and enjoy walking rather than riding car.

Furthermore, walking and riding a bike could make things possible for everyone. People need to notice that driving a car could make things much harder. According to this source 1: "" In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", "" In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are to act, if cautiously"". This quote states that the United States are planning to reduce car usage because it looks like many people today are having a lot of car accidents. For example, driving while texting. This can create less accidents.

In conclusion, Fellow citizens need to set their limits on car usage.

they need to realized on how it  can create a mess in the world full of car transportation. Also, knowing on how much they pay for gas  and also it can lead to massive traffic jams. They need to have  advantage of using car usage. They could ride a bike or walk to go reach their destination.            ","

F-M81,"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a male student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that he is on his mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger male students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this male student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing he is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the male student in a difficult position; leaving his to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now he doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or he tells the teacher in front of everyone that he is on his period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.

F-M82,"Are you against of this technology to read people's mind? I am against it because there are people out there that suffer and want to get over their life. If that technology read their mind and the world knows it they will suffer more and never get over it. Also, there are many good reasons to agree it and there are many reasons that I disagree. The technology might ruin every person's life.

In addition, I disagree with this technology because in the text, third paragraph says in order to read the expressions your face bone has to be different, but there are a lot of emotions that people don't show, you might be happy or sad and your face still the same. I don't think that tecnology can comprehend people's emotion and people's mind. Basically, the third paragraph says that emotion are base on your bones but I notice when I am sad, happy, disgust or mind blank my face is the same: a face that's blank minded. Most people can't read my mind and I don't think the technology can either.

Another reason that I don't agree with technology reads mind is because there are people who don't want people to know what's in them. For example, if there's a boy is unhappy and in order to make his friends to be happy he do everything and maybe no one will notice and his friends will be glad for his. If the technology reads his minds and let his knows about it, their friendship might be in chaos and ends.

Also, why I am disagree with it because I remeber one time my teacher told me that science is not always 100%. I don't think this technology is accurate because I notice when one of my friend is sad I can tell by the way he talks but not his expressions. In the text says that not only your facial muscles knows your emotion but also produce them, but what if your bone is twisted and have an unhappy seems face but you are actually happy. The article says that facial muscles produce emotion, I disagree with it because when I feel sad or blank most of the time my facial bones still the same.

In conclusion, this technology shouldn't invented because it might not be accurate and says false about people expresson. This technology can only read expression only by bone but not voice or heart so I don't think it's accurate. That's why we shouldn't use this technology because science is not always 100% correct. We should get to know the person's mind better instead of use technology to know theirs. If you don't know what's in them then, that means relationship is not close and it's better to learn their minds and know each other better.          ","

F-M83,"The claim is about other people that be hiding their emotions and the new software can developed accuracy of the emotion they have promised the applications for a variety of industies. It is a mentleman that is 83 percent happy and 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful.

He was a subject of Leonardo da Vinci Renaissance paniting Mona Lisa was the one that can recongize emotions he was the one that can demonstrat and bring a smile to your face so bascially he was just like a computer in way. Dr Huang was a smart person in the facial expressions he was the one that was trying to found out things about the human communication for technolgoly.

Imagine if you was looking in the mirror and you suggest an emotion can your lab partner recongize your emotion. I would say you could but it all depends because you can't really tell because he can have a face emotion that you see him with everyday that don't mean that he happy it can mean that he mad or sad or tired.

I closed this section by saying that all computers and scentist can't recongize everybody emotion because everybody is different and experience different test on there emotion so I think that it can be no or yes.

I would say you could but it all depends because you can't really tell because he can have a face emotion that you see him with everyday that don't mean that he happy it can mean that he mad or sad or tired.

I closed this section by saying that all computers and scentist can't recongize everybody emotion because everybody is different and experience different test on there emotion so I think that it can be no or yes.                                                                                                  ]""

F-M84,"I think the use of Facial Action Coding Symstem is an great way to identify students emotions. I believe that most students in classrooms become sod or lonely when he/he is doing work that the student doesn't understand. So with the facial action symstem it can interact with students to change their emotions from sad to happy.

It can help change emotions by showing different thing on the computer screens,for and example a student can be sad and the facial regonition can see that he/he is sad and then put something thats joyful on the screen.

The computer can tell if the a student is pretending to be happy or sad by your mucles. Pretending to be happy or sad will cause the symstem to bringout the student real emotions. Most students try to act sad to bring atttion to themselves. If a student appears sad to another student the other students tends to comfront him/he in the wrong way.                                           ","

Reason for the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) read the emotional expressions of a student can benefit by how the teacher can teach beacuse if a student make different emotions like confuse,bored or overwelm while a teacher teach can show that what the teacher is doing is not working.

Whe a sutend show a confuse emotion is showing that the work the teacher has given is to hard to comprehend. Showing to the tacher that he has giving to much of a hard work for a student to understand it. Giving that situation the teacher can make a plan to low donw to a level of the student grade he is teaching.

A bored student is not much good to have in a class because whe a student is bored it intent to start distrubtin a class or come to fall a sleep in class. Thas showing to the teacher that the way is teaching is has become to un-interesting,that should let the teacher know that his has has to come more interesting and\or active so students can show more curiosity to class and get inspired to learn the class.

When a student comes overwelm it coem a stress and start to panic for all the work the teaches have givin. Showing the student being overwelm shows teacher that it have giving to many work or the class have become to hard to comprihend. Tha so ones the teacher knows that student s have starting to become overwelm because of his class he has to star changin his plan of teaching so tudent can learn better and a eassy way.

In conclution the class room computer could reconice when the student is becoming confused or bore and /or overwelm. That could modify the lesson so it can be an efective to the human instructor.

But not such that. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everday. For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face.

Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling he is expressing and what is he feeling. For instance, some artists say he is happy but no one really knows what emotion he is feeling. In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things.

F-M89,"Limiting cars usage is a great idea. I believe that if we all come together and stop driving for a day, it will stop the pollution that is hurting the air we breath.

As Americans, we should be very concerned about the air we breath. Sometimes, we need our cars to go to different places in a great distance such as a relative place or even work. But on the other hand, we will get in our car and drive just to go to the store within a mile from our home. We should just walk. Limiting cars just might be the right idea.

When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way..."" (Source 1) Cars, in my opinion, it a accident waiting to happen. Car accidents, Hit-and-runs and all types of other indcidents with cars are a big stresser. Walking is much safer if you take the right precautions. You can get the exercise you need without the hassle of going on Weight Watcher or Jenny Craig. Just put the keys down for a day and walk!

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(Source 3) Limit cars, limit stress and limit the pollution that is hurting our eco system.

However, there still is a question unanswered: how will we get to the place we need to go thats not in walking distance? Limiting cars may save our ecosystem, but some people have to get to and from work or the doctor that is not in walking distance. For example, each day, my dad has to get to work in Tampa,FL. He has to take the expressway to get to where he is going. So what is he suppose to do? Walk? No. But on the better side of things, he can always take the bus or car-pool with his co-workers. Theres alway a better way to stop the pollution and save the ecosystem.

This shows that we can all come together and do something positive for our fellow Americans and Father Earth.

Limiting cars have more good advantages than disadvantages. We have to save the world from harmful thing. Limiting cars limits the time and money of people. Thats why when you limit cars, you limit stress. So take a walk and save the world!            ","

F-M90,"Do you really want to visit Venus? Because I sure do. But the problem is it's extremely dangerous. Mostly because the temperature there is 90 times greater than our normal temperature. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. That sound dangerous, and it is dangerous because it could hurt and possibly kill someone.

Venus is our brother planet. Some call us twins because of the sizes we both have. But, Venus is the closest to the sun like Mercury is the first panet next to the sun. So Venus is the warmer part of our brotherhood, and Earth are the cold part of our brotherhood. It's sort of like Venus is Anna because of his warm personality. And earth is like Elsa, because of his frozen powers, so he is extremely cold when it comes down to things. Earth at the moment is like Elsa because of its winter landish time of the year.

To be truthful, trying to go to Venus is a good way to learn more about the planets and to see if there is any living sources out there in the galaxy. But at the same time it's a good way to get killed.(not saying you should do it for the fun of it or for suicide.)

You should at least make some sort of suit that is safe for acid to hit it and so it doesn't melt your suit. It will be pretty cool to finally go to other planets and explore them.

For this entire essay I learned about new stuff. I learned that there is acid rain in Venus. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus, I thought that was cool to learn. I also learned that Mercury is the first planet in front of the sun. I totally forgot about that, so I was surprised. So that's what I learned.","

F-M91,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even with the dangers on the planet. Venus is the brother planet to Earth but the surface of Venus presents a challange to any living thing. Venus is also called the ""Evening Star"" despite it being a planet.

Venus is a planet that the most like Earth but we bearly studied it because we'll have to get on the planet to do so. Venus has around the same density and size as the Earth but Venus' surface is 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus' Atmosphere is dangrous as well with 97% of it being carbon dioxide and the clouds made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

When going across the ocean you can also have fun stuff to do on the ship.

When feeding and giving the animals water you need to give them food and water 2 or 3 times a day so they can be healthy. Some places you might go to on the ship is China, and Europe.

so i personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldnt really express there selfs to the class as if they were with there friends. so all we would have to do is just by a sinlge glimpes on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happend. and he doesnt really know what to do so he seeks help from a counceler and he just checks what is going on with his and just by that maybe his whole life could change by checking the computer. tech is advancing a lot and is helping the sociatey positivley and yet negativlily but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but potive stuff.

Decreasing our car usage will emprove the environment. In the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""  In France they banned even numbered liscence plates from driving, for one day, and one day was all it took for the high levels of smog to decrease. In another Artical ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it talks about the decrease usage of cars throught the years, paragraph 34 says "" If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" If the people keep slowing down on using cars, which scientist believe it will, there will be better carbon e,issions in the air, and the air will be better. Limiting car usage will help make our environment better.

Walking, biking, and skateing are all excercises that help you stay fit, but they are also a healthy alternative to cars. A artical published in the

Seattle Times called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky describes the day that is trending all over the world, the day cars are banned. People in these countries, in this case Colombia ""hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work"" Banning car usage enchourages people to get up and walk, run, or bike because they can't use their car. In the town Vauban, Germany a car free town, people walk everywhere, because the town has no cars. In the town ""...where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" The people in this town are walking and staying fit everyday.

One last benifit of limited car usage is it causes people less stress. Heidrun Walter , a father of two who lives in Vauban, Germany, says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now."" Once Walter sold his car he was relived, he didn't have to worry about making his next car payment, when he would have to get gas again, or how much money gas was. Getting rid of his car relived his stress. Not using cars will decrease the amount of stress in society.

Over all, limiting are car usage would greatly benifit us, it will help keep the environment clean, keep our people healthy, and it will cause people less stress.                     ","

F-M99,I think that having the use of that technology in a class room. I think it would be a good idea because then teachers would know if something was wrong with the students and they could do something about it. Or if the students were not into the lesson the teachers was teaching and the teachers could try to change the lesson up a bit. It could also be helpful because if the student was sad the teacher would know and could try to help the student out in some kind of way. Or say like if the student was mad and the teacher didnt know the student could lash out of them and that would be bad but with the 3d computer the teacher could find out and could stay out of their way or try to help. Or say there was a bully in the class and the teacher didnt know and they had just made a new seating chart and they put the bully right by one of their victims and the student was scared you could use the 3d computer and check the student and see that he or he is scared you can solve the promblem right there and wouldnt have to worry about in the future. For example say if the teacher had a special day and he wanted to bring the students a treat so he baked some cookies and he brought the cookies to the students when their eating them he could check to see if they are happy and surprise that he brought them some cookies. Or if some of the students showed no the emotion to the teacher bringing them the 3d computer could tell them that. Say for example the students in the class took a test and normally everbody is feeling mad and bored but when they take this test all of them get a B+ or higher you could check the 3d computer and see they were all comfadent and ready for this test. In conclusion the 3d computer would be a good to use in a classroom and something teachers need.,"

F-M100,"This software is valuable, for the simple fact of i""ve seen alot of photos. knowing whats this painting is feelings can help you understand. In the ""Mona Lisa"" he has diferent emotions going on. Just looking at the painting you woudlnt think that there is any type of emotion, but thats when the machine kicks in.

Mona llisa lacks a big smile, but he 83% happy. If thats the case more paintings need to go thru this machine. Also Mona lisa was 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Just from looking at the painting what would you think? I dont even know what I thought his expressions were. It's hard to tell but this machine helped out alot.

So, yes the software is vaulable, not every day you hear about a machine that calculates emotion. If we had this machines in school you'd know whats wrong with your girlfreind or friend. Reading about this makes me question alot of pictures now. Now i think and ask how many other paintings have a meaning to it.      ","

F-M101,"Studies have been proven that people are starting to not drive cars as much, Americans are buying fewer cars, and getting fewer licenses. There are several advantages to not driving cars every where, beneficial implications for carbon emissions, the environment and improves safety.

Vauban's streets in germany are completely ""car free."" People who do not drive cars any more and ride bikes, walks or rides the tram are said to be more happier this way. A father of two walks and rides his bikes every where with his kids and does not feel as tense and stressed as he did when he was driving.

Also a huge advantage is it drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Diesel fuel was banned in France since tax policies favored dieselover gasoline. Delivery companiess complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made, plug-in-cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers.

In Paris there were days of near record pollution, so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below average and equal to the country in January 1995. ""The rate of car ownership per household and per person came down two to three years before the downturn."" Michael Sivak stated. New York has a new bike sharing program and the skyrocketing bridges and tunnel tolls reflect people to want to not drive cars anymore.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, just shows you that the beneficial implications, environment and easier way of saving money does make people want to start biking, walking, using a tram, etc. Those examples I gave you are a few advantages of limiting car use.         ","

F-M102,"I think the Facial Action Coding System is pretty good, but I think it has a few problem.

The Mona Lisa is a hard painting, because every people have a different opinion about it. For example some people say he is sad, angry, but some people say he is happy. This Facial Action Coding System can help us. It says Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. This program can read by muscles so it can help us if we have painting and we need analys that. It has classifield six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. If we raise our eyebrows then we are surprised. This system can mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. It says we can probably tell how our friend is feeling by the look on his/his face, but it is not always true. I think everybody had experience when he/he was smiling but he/he was sad inside. And I think this program can not read this if we are similing but we are sad inside. It says the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. It could be good if the students bored or confused but a computer never being a human. In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth and it was instruction #1. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around eyes. It was instructions #2. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces do not lie. The emotionals very important in our life. If our friend is sad but if we are positive and we are smiling than maybe he/he will smile.

This technology is pretty good. It has a lot of examples how it is working and it is good if we need to use this program in class. For example analysing painting. But I don not think it always could be analysing human emotionals.","

F-M104,"Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because many student will come into the classroom with sad face and nobody will know what is wrong with them but with the Facial Action Coding System, everybody will know what is wrong with a person if he/he is sad in class, And is not everybody that feel happy everyday but with this kind of technology we will be able to know what is wrong with them and we will make sure they feel happy.

In paragraph 5 the author say that in fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""caculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on his face. But some people can tell how a person feel but only the person friend and that is not good but with the Facial Action Coding System evrybody will be able to tell how a person feel not only the person friend.

In paragraph 6 it say that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and that will make the teacher find something that will u feel happy and keep u busy. But without the Facial Action Coding System the teacher will not be able to know what is wrong with a student is either they are confused or bored he won't be able to tell becuase he can't know how the student feel but with the computer the teacher can see if the students are happy or not and they are not happy he will be able to find a way to make them happy.

So the Facial Action Coding System will be valuable in classroom so the teacher can know the feeling of his student.          ","

F-M106,"Mona Lisa is one of the worlds most famous paintings, but did you know that even though he isnt real computers can still reconize his face and unlock things. In the article ""Mona Lisa Smiles"", by Nick D' Alto he explanes how Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, made a system where computer can reconize your face. Many may argue that the new facial action coding system leads the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable this is shown by, Mona Lisa being able to be reconized by compters even though he's a painting, computer can knowlege the students faces and lastly, the computers can make you happy.

Firstly, Mona Lisa is being able to be reconized by computer even though he is a painting. Dr. Paul Eckman made a system where computers unlock themselves and consisders your emotion by your facial expressiona and the tempertures from your body. Nick states, ""He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D' Alto 1). This quote show that the computers saw his facial expression and determined how he was feeling. It also shows that the computers can see anyones face and unlock any device.

Secondly, computer can reconize their faces and only unlock for the students. The system would be very useful in school because it will determine the students facial expreesion and alert the teacher or the computer if the student needs help or is having a difficult time with their work. Nick states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D' Alto 6).

F-M107,"Its valuable to use a technolgy that can read the emotional expressions of a student. I find it important to know how someone really feels and what they may be going through. For an example, many people hide what they truly feel, because of what others think. I have a great friend that really does not express themselves when we go out and hang, he always seems to be bored. The reality is that he has fun and likes the things I like, He may seem like he is bored, but you can tell when he is enjoying himself, he makes a small smile and looks over to the other side when he does not want me to see that he is having fun.

Having Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa is a great way to tell others an expression of all six basic emotions. The way Leonardo used his painting to get every single muscle to go with its roll in each six basic emotional expression of Mona Lisa.

We all have six basic emotions, which are: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and saddness. It is a surprise knowing when we humans are surprised an expression is shown in our faces, in the third paragraph the author says "" your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow"" when you're surprise. The most common facial expression is happy. In paragraph 7 it talks about how the instructions above were a happy face instuction, it also includes how their is a difference between a real and a false smile. Us humans have real emotional expressions. Our true expression never lie how we truly feel, as said in paragraph 8 "" faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In todays world many people express themselves and many people don't. In the reality many people hide what feel and make a lying expression, with noticeable information on the lying expression. In instance in paragraph 7, with the instuctions of making a smile, Having a false smile is different than a real smile. For example, in paragraph 8 the author talks about the muscle in the smile, "" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make a crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This tells how a false expression can be noticable and yet use to make a lie.

A technology that can read an expression of a student would be great, so that a teacher may know how a student is feeling and can help or observe. As known many famous people lie about how they feel and we as humans are no different than a celebrity. We all have emotion expressions that we express and falsely express to fool someone. Helping the ones who are sad and angry, fear and disgusted to succed and the ones who feel happy to succed as well.

Having the technology that can read emotion expressions in a classroom of student is valuable. Since most students don't want to express their feeling phiscally. These are my reasons why having a technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable.       ","

F-M110,"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years, different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their ""goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to ""clear the air of the global city."" This is due to ""days of near-record pollution."" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and father of two, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his husband. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage boy in front of you isn't paying attention because he is talking on the phone and doing his mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressfull days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.    ","

F-M112,"I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one. I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall. When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or he most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or he is a elector he or he gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or he wants.

I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a ceratin candiate running for president. By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/his is not likely to change his or his mind and vote for the exact person you want he or he to vote for. It stated in the article that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or his own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party."" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.

This does make the candiate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candiate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost. It stated in the article that ""A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.""So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for.

I think the Electoral college is great and well organized the process is good and the only thing is does is make the voting process more easier and ordered. I think we should keep it i mean it has had his troubles his and there but it has worked so good for such a long time. We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well. I hope this is the way we keep on voting i think its great and that changing it would just make things harder on everybody.    ","

We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well. I hope this is the way we keep on voting i think its great and that changing it would just make things harder on everybody.    ]""

F-M115,"In the artical, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

the author feels that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"", meaning no matter how dangerous Venus really is, he/he thinks it would still be a good idea to explore or even just get a better understanding of Venus.

The author goes into detail on how Venus is one of the closest plants to us, and is even the most earth like plant. They say Venus has vallys, mountins, craters, and even might have had water many years ago. They say how we haven't touch or landed on Venus in a few decades because the atmospher is so dangerous, and he/he wants us to try to be able to have life there on Venus.

The author says that venus is often refered to as earths twin, all because of the fetures it has, he/he then goes on to say that each and every previous misson was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no spacecraft survives a landing on mars for even a few hours. He/he says that Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon, that just covers venus like a blanket, and that the temperature average on venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit with a atmospheric pressur about 90 times greater that on earth. those conditions are much more extreame, and would take much more advanced technology.

So the author says that he/he thinks that exploring venus and being able to have life on venus again would be great, if we can get the technology that is required to be able to get up there and actually be able to land for more then a few hours. He/he also thinks that it would be great to be able to have life on Venus or have that as a back up eath. They go on to give us many deatils on how Venus is unsafe for our technology at the moment, and how hard it would be to get there and stay for a long time, but they also go to say a good start would be being able to just get samples of the gas or the rocks on Venus and jsut move on from that point on.","

F-M116,"Kat was a twenty-two year old boy who was driving to the store late at night. He had realized that he needed to get his little brother a present for his birthday tomorrow. Kat was tired from a long day of studying for his upcoming collage finals, so it didn't take long for his to pass out at the wheel. Kat's vehicle sped into a tree off to the side of the road. Kat died from his injuries. But imagine Kat had been guiding a driverless car. When Kat fell asleep, the car would have sensed itself going off course and would have corrected its path or woken up Kat. The advantages of a driverless car would apply to more than just Kat's situation. Driverless cars would be a luxury for drivers all around the world due to their advanced safety features, automatic transportation, and convenience to the driver.

The impact that driverless cars could eventually have is exponential. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" has many good points on to what they could do for the world in the future. At one point the article reads, ""...how much smarter did the cars have to be? For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors. The advancement of the sensors used would help to stop many of the car crash deaths in the United States and beyond. The automatic driving feature would give the driver so much time for other things. You could read a book on your way to work, or play a game with the kids while on a roadtrip.

Some say that a driverless car is much too dangerous, and that a machine can never be better than a human. They believe that humans will always be needed to drive cars. This is understandable as a computer driving a car is a foriegn concept. However, they would be wrong in their assumption.

The ""Smart Cars"" being developed today are not more efficient than a human, however, this will most likely not be the case for long. With the current rate of technological development, We will have cars that can drive themselves without human assistance within the next 30 years. The next generation might be used to only learning the very basics of driving, as they might not need that skill.

With all the good that driverless cars could do for the world, it's a wonder anyone questions their value. The potential for safety and convenience is much to high to pass up on. Driverless cars are the future of our roads. Very soon, driverless cars will be sold at car dealerships and open to the public.","

F-M117,"""Hi my name is Luke I am a Seagoing Cowboy,"" I thought in my head. No, ""How are you today?"" I thought again, ""How are you today, my name is Luke, I am a Seagoing Coybow!"" ""Yes!"" I said outloud. I am trying to convince people to join the Seagoing Coybows program. It is a program about helping others in Europe and give them what they need.

I went up to a boy who looked to be about 18. I told him,""How are you?"" He said,""Im doing horrible, I just lost my job at the bar."" I said,""I am very sorry to hear that, but i have something to offer you, by the way how old are you?"" He said, ""I am 19 years old, but what is this offer you are giving me?"" I said, ""Ok thats good, I am a Seagoing Coybow, we are looking for people that want to help others in Europe by giving them what they need."" He said, ""No way, i've been trying to join the program but I missed the singups, im in, also my name is Gavin!""

I said, ""Glad to hear!"" I also said, ""Do you have any friends or family that want to join the program?"" He said, ""I don't know, hmm, maybe my friend Ben?"" I said, ""Great, do you think you can go on my ride and go to his house if he is home?"" He said, ""Yes, he is home right now!"" I said,""How old is he?"" He said, ""He is 23 years old, met him at my job, we were both fighting over something, but we became friends!""

We both rode in my wagon. We made it to his house. I knocked on the door three times no answer. Then when Gavin knocked on the door in a wierd sort of pattern we could hear footsteps. Ben came down he looked big and strong.

I asked him,""Hey Ben, I have met your friend Gavin today, he is going to be joining the Seagoing Coybows program, are you interested in joining?"" He said, ""No sounds dumb."" I said, ""How is it dumb to help people in need?"" He said, ""I don't wanna help just like I said the first time and I don't care! Ben's dad came downstairs.

He yelled, ""Who is it and what do you want with me and my son!"" I said, ""We are just seeing if he is interested in joining a program!"" He ran downstairs and now we saw his. He was tall and had blue eyes with blonde hair. He said, ""What type of program?"" I said, ""The Seagoing Coybows program, I have made 9 trips across the oceans, the most any Seagoing Coybow has, I was recruited in it in 1945 and it is an amzing job, I have been on many amazing adventures and got to visit cool places, you also help people in need!"" He said the same thing that Ben said.

He said, ""There is no point in doing it!"" I said, ""How is it bad to help people in need?"" He said, ""Why should I care?"" Ben said, ""I know right?"" I said, ""What if you were that person in need and needed food,supplies, and transportation?"" ""Wouldn't you want help? He said, ""I guess your right, son you should sing up seems like a great offer to travel places and help people."" Ben said, ""That's dumb, I don't care about them, I care about me, look I need a haircut and you want me to help people instead that I don't care about at all?""

I said,""I will pay for your haircut and it is an amazing offer just like your dad said!"" He said, ""What would you do in the boats?"" I said, ""You would feed and water the animals, but there is also fun things to do like play volleyball,ping pong,fencing,boxing,and reading!"" He said, ""Sounds good I guess I will join!"" I said, ""Ok great!"" We all left the small town and got on the boats. It was going to be a great adventure!   ","

F-M118,"Have you ever thought of being the only person in the car, and not having to drive? The idea of self-driving cars have been around since the late 1950's. Yeah, sure, it'd be cool to have a computer automated car, but this would take away the fun of driving.

Then again, it would cost less gas to have a coumputer dive your car for you, but if you wanted not to drive you could just call a taxi or catch a bus. The positive effects of self-driving cars are endless. The negative effects are also there to opose the positives.

Let's say my grandpa is physiclly disabled and can't drive, a self-driving car could take his places without his having to call a family member or friend to come assist his. This is one positive effect. Now let's look at another senaro. Let's say it's a very hot day, and everything that's in the direct sun light is over 100 degrees. the sun would eventually fry or over heat the circuts inthe computer programing. The people cooler climates would have same but oposite effects. The wires and electical currents would freeze due to the cold climate.

So would you wanna have a self-driving car, or to drive the car yourself. the positives and negatives show. This is my postions on the ""drverless/self-driving car"". I will stick to traditional driving, with my foot on the pedal and my hands on the wheel.   ","

Let's say my grandpa is physiclly disabled and can't drive, a self-driving car could take his places without his having to call a family member or friend to come assist his. This is one positive effect. Now let's look at another senaro. Let's say it's a very hot day, and everything that's in the direct sun light is over 100 degrees. the sun would eventually fry or over heat the circuts inthe computer programing. The people cooler climates would have same but oposite effects. The wires and electical currents would freeze due to the cold climate.

So would you wanna have a self-driving car, or to drive the car yourself. the positives and negatives show. This is my postions on the ""drverless/self-driving car"". I will stick to traditional driving, with my foot on the pedal and my hands on the wheel.   ]""

F-M119,"I think that it would be a great idea limiting the usage of cars and what the advantages are beacuse when people have cars u hearing about crahes and all the other bad stuff. so a good way to revent al this from happening would be to get rid of car uasage and make people bike or walk to wherever they want to go to. Also limiting the usage of cars would prevent all the bad stuff from happening and help have a safer life and a longer one too.

In source it talks about how their are now cars in germany in the Suburbs. street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden. In the new approach stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some istant highway. Heidrun Walter is a father of two and use to have a car but sold to move to germany because alot of people alot of people dont have cars and he feels safre their because he knows that his children are going to be safe their. when he drove a car he felt all tense and freaked out. So in germany they tring ti create walking to stores or plaes that are like a block away because they feel like that is the best method.

The adavntages would be that u dont have to worry about getting all thses fines, getting your car impoud and not having to pay the fee. Also when u havea car u have to pay for the car insurance, the gas. Also it wouldnt create any cathos on the road and u would be much safre if the usage of cars went away because u wouldnt have to hear about car accidents that killed people. It would be a stress free world if cars went away. Also an advantage would be that u dnt have to worry about getting stuff stolen.

Ive explained to u that the limiting of cars would be a great idea because then u dont have to worry about all the bad things that could happen to the u if u had a car and u could walk somewhere or bike somewhere and that would be better than cras because it would be safer than a car.                                                                    ","

F-M121,"What make a person wonder about how the other people feel about them? Imagine being able to know exactly how a person feel and their emotion toward you or other things. Dr. Huang, the prof. of the Beakman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, have created a way for us to figure people emotion. He created the Facial Action Coding System. Facial Action Coding System is a system that make you understand a person emotion by the muscles in

their face. The use of this technology to read emotion is valuable for many reason.The reason are that it will make us understand how our friends are feeling, to make sure the politician or celebrity is being truthful, and it help us with our

everyday life.

The first reason is that the Facial Action Coding Stystem will help us understand how our friends feel. According to paragraph 5, and line 2, it stated that "" you can probable tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his face."" There always that friend that doesn't express himself well. If he need help with his life or when he is sad he won't understand how to express these emotion to his friends. This will help the people to understand how they feel and know when they need a shoulder to lean on.

Futhermore, the technology will help the citizen identify whether the politician or the president is being truthful. Paragraph 8, line 4-6, it explain, "" these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful."" If we don't have this type of way to figure out if our politician are worth it, then the world would be a mess. We would never know if that person is very truthful in his or his job. Also it a good way to find that good president that will guide us with real emotion and not a fake one.

The last reason is that the tecnology will help us with our everyday life. According to

the last paragraph, it stated that "" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.(""Putting on a

happy face"" actually work!)"" When we have work or when

go out it always important to have a happy face. When you look mad and depressed, other people around you will know and they will judge you. Having a happy face will make the other think highly of you. You will be able to get along with your co-worker very well. It to make your life easier and better.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System is valuabe because it allow you to understand your peers emotion, when a politician is being truthful, and help you make many friend. Some may argue that it personal and it not our buisness to know how a person feel. In order to make our world better, everyone should understand each other emotion for it to be easier to communicate. Other will understand and make this world peaceful.","

F-M122,"It is a good technology to have. People can lie about how they feel. In the painting of Mona do u really know he was happy. No a comupter can say that but it a painting of the person that is not around. So you don't know it just he face everyday. He has no eyebrows so how can you so he is suprised. In the text it says your eyebrows Well you cant have that if there isn't any.

So thing that it is a good technology to have but it just not proven to work on paint. The students don't realy need to know how to use a computer to see how people are feeling. People most of the time you can tell by looking on there faces. Why is it important to know picture or a painting is feeling when you look at it should do it for you. How do you say he is 83 percent happy you can't put that like it a math problem. Because you don't know how see really feels because it could just be a face for all we know.

That is why I think is would be worthless for students to use it. They cant use a comupter to see how someone is feeling inside them. It is a good advancement and can be use but in another way. People can hide how they are feeling just by there face. It also not something students need to learn to go far in life.","

Cars in the modern day are playing a huge role in many people everday lives, most even depend on the car to move on with the ir days. What most don't know is that the use cars provide more issuse within their daily lives than not using them. for example a father of two from vauban, germany states that "" when he used a car everyday he used to be very tense, and now that he has given away his car theat he is much happier"". scientist have proven that "" having to keep a car up and running, and dealing with all of the maintence that comes with it is casing many families to begin pinching pennies"".

After a day of a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog in paris; congestion on the streets was down 60%, and the smog nearly covering France also lessened. The main cause of the build up of smog over France is because of the cold nights and warm days caused the warm layer of air in the atmosphere to trap car emissions. The use of diesel fuel in France also contributed to the intensifiying smog; considering that diesel fuel is used in 67% of vehicles in France.

The emission of Greenhouse gases from cars is destroying our enviroment and atmosphere which could potentially end up harming people in the long hall.

F-M124,"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe.  In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as  people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a man who says that when he had a car he was always tense, but living in Vauban (the car- free city) has made his much happier. He is able to walk or bike everywhere that he needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his husband. This allows for more bonding with his husband as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the enviroment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the enviroment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rush-hour every day.  Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.                  ","

It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.                  ]""

F-M125,"Today is the day where children are coming to tour NASA. As I am walking around, I think of questions the children might ask. ""Who was the first person on the moon?"", is the most frequently asked question. Then I remember that there is a new part in NASA's building. Recently, they added photos and information on the ""Face on Mars"". I think to myself, ""This should definately intrest the children.""

Soon enough, a little yellow bus pulled into the parking lot. Five children came tumbling out, all excited to see what is indoors. ""Asher, stop it!"", a little brown haired boy yelled. As soon as they were all out, the stood in a straight line, covering their eyes from the sun while looking at the huge building. I look the children's faces. I only know one child, because another said his name.

""Welcome to NASA. We are so very glad you guys could come. Please, let me introduce myself. I am Maddie, and I will be showing you around today. Follow me inside, so we can get out of this dreadful heat!"", I say. The five children come chasing after me, and their teacher tells them to slow down. One by one, the children enter the building, fascinated by all the pictures hanging from the walls. Asher asks, ""Are aliens really real?"". As I go to respond, the little brown haired boy says, ""Of course not. That's just in movies. I want to know about the Face on Mars."". I was stunned he knew about that, because it was just recently added on NASA's walls.

I lead the children to the elevator, which just so happened to be across the room. ""Let's go and see the Face on Mars. I think I should tell you about it first. The Face on Mars is a natural landform which-"" I was then interupted by a new face. ""It is not a natural landform, my brother told me that it was created by the aliens."" I give his a puzzled look and respond, ""We have not found any form of life on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, excluding Earth. As I was saying, the Face on Mars in a natural landform which means that it happened naturally. It was not made by any aliens"". The boy looked at me, frusterated, and said, ""Prove it.""

The elevator door opens and the children come swarming out, running up to the pictures of the Face. I say, ""Here, it says that the Face is a ""huge rock formation"", so that means that when the universe was created, so was that rock. That rock is just shaped like a head."". All of a sudden, the young boy smiled and said, ""Oh, I can't wait to tell my brother that he was wrong!""

The children wrote everything I told them down in their notebooks. Shortly, we had to part and say goodbye. The kids all came up and hugged me, saying that they were thankful for getting chosen to come. They piled back into the bus this time, instead of piling out. I waved goodbye as they set off.

In conclusion, the kids all realized that the Face, is just a natural landform, made when Mars was created or after. The children know that still to this day, we are looking all over the universe to find something new and exciting to share with them. I am so gald that they could come and experience this with us.

F-M126,"Introduction-

People, Muesums, and Schools are still wandering ""to this day"" if Leonardo Da Vinci made his famous painting of Mona Lisa with a smile on ""his"" face, well, in Paragraph 1(Lines 1-2), there is a descripion of how Nick D'Alto is saying that Mona Lisa is Eighty-Three percent happy, Nine percent disgusted, Six percent fearful, and Two percent angry. The new technology system being described in the

Facial Action Coding System (suggested by Dr. Huang) could possibly make a big difference of how Mona Lisa ""REALLY FEELS"", and how it would be easier for students to learn about whether or not ""He"" was made ""HAPPY"" in Da'Vinci's paintings.

Body Paragraph-

Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what he might have seemed like in his face, and he might have been fearful because of his hair style and his looks ""in the dark!"" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with ""2020 Vision Software"", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology. I think that this kind of technology is kind of un-realistic, but it would be a good source for what the person studying in will thinks about what he learned in the past ""Once enough of the Life-Story of the person has gone by."" In Paragraph 3 ""Lines 18-31"", I would imagine that constructing a computer that has a lot of functions and features could lack the knowledge of a person's understanding of how to ""USE"" the computer properly, which will turn out to be more like ""TRASHWARE"" than ""SOFTWARE"". The biggest part I think the Facial Action Coding System ""Is Worth"" is how you can just control anything in your ""IMAGINATION"" to discover the strong ways that you can make video games from your imagination, show how you truly feel, and picture yourself "" in that video game."" Dr. Huang is not a bad ""Pre- Innovator"", but he could have added specific date(s) to his context.

Conclusion-

If a type of computer with 3-D software were to exist, then there would be a great possibility that by Two- Thousand Twenty, there will be the greatest chance of a computer with special features existing ""if Dr. Huang will start planning how the computer he's wishing to come out will be invented.""","

F-M127,"Have you ever wishes you could read the emotions of another person? With new technology created by Thomas Huang you can do just that. This device allows you to precicly calculate the emotions and feelings of anoother person. But would it be valuable in a classroom of students.

In my personal opinion i say yes it would be valuable. I think it would not only be valuable to students but also to teachers. It would be helpfull to students because say for example you have a crush on a fellow classmate but dosent know how he feels about you with a app called snapchat you are able to communicate through pictures, so if you knew how he felt about the conversation based on the selfie he sent it would give you a accurate idea of how he feels about you. A reason i think it would be helpfull to teachers is it would allow them to know when a kid becomes bored or sleepy ultimatly helping on how to teach and what subjects catches your class attention.

So do i think that it is a good idea to have a emotion detector in a classroom. Over all yes because it has it's pro's such ass helping a student with his crush or helping a teacher deliver a lesson planor know when a student it sleeping. But it can also have its con's. So when deciding to put one in a classroom of your own dont only look at the neggatives or posotives but compare and see which outways the other.          ","

F-M128,"It's incredible how the technology is able to know your emotions. It's like the techonology is trying to communicate with us, but will it be useful for school and teachers? In this passage I'm going to tell you, why having the technology is valuable and useful for school and teachers.

The use of this technology that is able to read the emotional expressions of studnets in a classroom is valuable becuase it's important that the teachers know the emotions that his students. This technology can help the teachers understand the students btter for example, the teacher is giving a lesson the teacher needs to know if they're bored or confused so he or he can do something about his or his lessons.

If the students are bored then he or he can change the ways they teach, by adding some fun activities to try and keep thier students attention, enocourage students to learn and pay attention to what the teacher is teaaching. If the student is confused then the teacher can try and help the students by giving them more examples and talking about the topic more. Having this sort of technology is great becuase many of the students don't want to ask their teacher for help when they're confused in a certain topic. The students might be afraid that the teacher might get displeased or made fun of from the other students.

In the text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""A classromm copmputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". It says that the computer can read the students emotions when they are bored an confused, like I said before.

In conclusion, Using this sort of technology would help many teachers and many schools because they would know how his or his students feel. Also, help them with thier lessons and way of teaching. Creating new ways to teach and enocurage the students to learn and be in school.      ","

F-M130,"Seagoing Cowboys

Just like Luke people should become seagoing Cowboys.

People should join this force because it's fun not only fun it helps you explore the world, like New Orleans, Greece , Venice, and even China. I'm sure there is many more places Luke visited and just didn't talk about.

Boeing a seagoing cowboy isn't always about fun and games. Sure that's one thing but it's also a duty. It's a duty to get you're animals from one country to another, or farmers wouldn't have cattle, butchers wouldn't have bulls,etc. but without them some countries wouldn't have bulls, mules, and horses. Even know it's a duty seagoing bulls are always helping in they're own way. They get animals from one place to another but they are also kind. I'm sure if someone was having a bad day and to pick up a horse, the seagoing Cowboys were there to help.

So please take this information and spread it to others we need more seagoing Cowboys. They are important, thank you for reading. And take my advice and become a seagoing cowboy with your own free will.","

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".

From the reduction of cars on the roads the congestion percent soared down a plump number of 60 percent. That's truely a magnificent amount.

I strongly believe that limitng the car usage would reduce death rates, reduce smog, put people in less tense moods keeping them more happy, and lastly reduce moeny going to greenhouse gas wages.

F-M136,"I think driverless cars are a good thing because it would take so much pressure off the driver him/himself. What i mean by pressure is moving around wrecks or moving slowly through traffic without bumping another car. it would aslo make it easier for the driver to not hit anybody like a crosswalk or constrution zone.

Another from of pressure that is on the driver is passengers. If a dad has just picked up his two children and they are fighting or crying in the back seat the driverless car would take over so he could attend to his fighting for crying children in the backseat. If you go out with your friends to ""party"" and end up not sutable to drive you can have the driverless car take over as well.

People are saying that driverless cars are bad thing because there are more wrecks and more people are dying in these wrecks. I think they are a good thing because if the driverless cars are causing wrecks that gives the manufactures more clues on how to make the cars safer.People also say that theyre bad because people are dying in these wrecks, I say dont worry about it because people are dying everyday.

Lets face it some people arent the best drivers in the world. so why not have driverless cars to help with those type of people. Some people get distracted or get tired, these cars will help with that. If you get distracted you have a car that will drive itself while you text or look at something on the side of the road. You and your family are going on vacation far away and you get tired, locate a hotel that is near had have the car assist you on your way to the hotel.

In conclusion I think driverless cars are a good thing to have because it would help out so many people that either cant drive, get distraced or just get bored of driving all together. Its just another step towards the future. ","

F-M138,"""Honey, could you go to the CVS and get me some nyquil.

I'm dying here,"" dad says.

""Yeah, I'll be back in a bit.""

I grab my keys from my pocket and head outside. I unlock my new driveless car and climb in. ""Take me to the CVS,"" I tell the car. It roars to life and backs out of the parking lot. It's been not even two miles and this thing is starting to glitch. ""You will be taking possesion of this car in five minutes, pa'am,"" the car commands. I panic and take hold of the violently shaking steering wheel. Traffics harsh tonight meaning there's some kind of party out in town. The driveless car just unexpectedly starts going in the wrong direction, making me go in shock.

Before I do a full turn I see a mentleman talking to his baby inside the car. I try to brake, but it just won't budge. I pray that I won't do any harm to them. Unfortunetly it does. I run smack into the front rear, making me black out. They say that before you die, your life flashes back through your eyes. But mine didn't.

I instintly think of dad, dying there in his room, waiting for me to come back. But I won't and this is all because of this driveless car. As you can see driveless cars are not safe because it can harm people, it's new technology is very unfamiliar, and it is not as driveless as you think.

Millions of people will die if you provide them with these cars. If you think harm is done only to you, then you are wrong. You can injure lots of people with only one lifeless car. A car with a mind that could turn into your enemy. It might seem a great idea to most of all over social media, but once they buy them then you will harm then. Not only will they sue the company, but have a bad record on there shoulders.

As you can see, new technology can be very unpredictable.

You won't know what is in this bizzare car that is being monitored with itself. And as the article says, it will also monitor you.

I think that this is not just crazy but scary too. And with this new technology you won't learn to handle a car by yourself, and I would want to.

These driveless cars you've been hearing about aren't always true.

It will say that it drives itself. It will eventually come to some point where the car can't handle the heavy traffic and pass it on to you. Yep that's right, you get to control a car that does not want to be handled.

A driveless car is a facade for hidding the real truth. Because that's what it's doing.

Hiding the truth.

These driveless cars I've been telling you about won't make this world any better.

Imagine Earth being invaded by robots. That's right, the new apacolypse. You see these can be extremely dangerous to the environment and the people inside the car. This new technology can't be acurate. There can be some huge change in it that you won't see it coming from two inches away.

And this driveless car being controlled but not by its driver is a false fact. You will eventually drive it too. But this new experiment may be the cause of not returning to your home and giving your dad that nyquil that he wanted so badly because he was dying.

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M138 / ""Honey, could you go to the CVS and get me some nyquil.

I'm dying here,"" dad says.

""Yeah, I'll be back in a bit.""

I grab my keys from my pocket and head outside. I unlock my new driveless car and climb in. ""Take me to the CVS,"" I tell the car. It roars to life and backs out of the parking lot. It's been not even two miles and this thing is starting to glitch. ""You will be taking possesion of this car in five minutes, pa'am,"" the car commands. I panic and take hold of the violently shaking steering wheel. Traffics harsh tonight meaning there's some kind of party out in town. The driveless car just unexpectedly starts going in the wrong direction, making me go in shock.

Before I do a full turn I see a mentleman talking to his baby inside the car. I try to brake, but it just won't budge. I pray that I won't do any harm to them. Unfortunetly it does. I run smack into the front rear, making me black out. They say that before you die, your life flashes back through your eyes. But mine didn't.

I instintly think of dad, dying there in his room, waiting for me to come back. But I won't and this is all because of this driveless car. As you can see driveless cars are not safe because it can harm people, it's new technology is very unfamiliar, and it is not as driveless as you think.

Millions of people will die if you provide them with these cars. If you think harm is done only to you, then you are wrong. You can injure lots of people with only one lifeless car. A car with a mind that could turn into your enemy. It might seem a great idea to most of all over social media, but once they buy them then you will harm then. Not only will they sue the company, but have a bad record on there shoulders.

As you can see, new technology can be very unpredictable.

You won't know what is in this bizzare car that is being monitored with itself. And as the article says, it will also monitor you.

I think that this is not just crazy but scary too. And with this new technology you won't learn to handle a car by yourself, and I would want to.

These driveless cars you've been hearing about aren't always true.

It will say that it drives itself. It will eventually come to some point where the car can't handle the heavy traffic and pass it on to you. Yep that's right, you get to control a car that does not want to be handled.

A driveless car is a facade for hidding the real truth. Because that's what it's doing.

Hiding the truth.

These driveless cars I've been telling you about won't make this world any better.

Imagine Earth being invaded by robots. That's right, the new apacolypse. You see these can be extremely dangerous to the environment and the people inside the car. This new technology can't be acurate. There can be some huge change in it that you won't see it coming from two inches away.

And this driveless car being controlled but not by its driver is a false fact. You will eventually drive it too. But this new experiment may be the cause of not returning to your home and giving your dad that nyquil that he wanted so badly because he was dying.

Do you want that?        ]""

F-M139,"The author supports the idea of studying Venus well because he/he provides excellent evidence and data to support his/his claim. The auhor's reason as to why he/he wants to study Venus is because Venus is the most Earth-like planet and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an idea to send humans to Venus.

The author uses the evidence that Venus is the most Earth-like planet because Venus has some features close to Earth. The reasoning is that, from paragraph four, Venus has a rocky surface that has features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This is great evidence because it helps prove the point that Venus was a planet like Earth and that connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author uses the evidence that NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus because NASA has a project that will allow scientists to float above Venus. The author's reasoning is that, in paragraph five, NASA came up with the idea of a vehicle hovering over Venus and it will allow the scientists to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. This is great evidence because it will prove that scientists do not need to get harmed in order to study Venus, which connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

F-M140,"Everybody wants privacy. Sometimes it is a good thing to leave a person alone, whether he or he is feeling sad, happy or angry. Using this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students is not valuable.

There might come a time when a person is sad because he or he has lost a loved one. That person probably would not want anyone knowing how he or he is feeling at the moment. If a computer is used to understand his or his emotions, it could cause that person to be more upset or sad. The computer could acknowledge emotional expressions, but it still has yet to learn how to respond in a situation where that person needs help. In paragraph six, the author states that a computer can know whether you're feeling happy or sad, confused or bored. In school, when a student needs help, the person can just raise his or his hand to get help from the teacher. A computer will most likely use complicated words to modify the lesson.

The problem is the new technology can read emotions, but it cannot really understand the person as much as a human being can. On most of the paragraphs in this article, paragraph eight for example, the author describes about how the computer looks at facial expression to understand someone's emotion. In school, there are shy kids who are afraid to ask for help. Normally, those shy kids are smart students who get good grades. It is true that one cannot just assume all shy kids are smart. But in this case, it is more likely that a shy student will ask help from a teacher, who can understand him or his a little bit better, than a computer that can just read facial expressions.

This technology could also end friendships or relationships. In paragraph seven and eight, the author mentioned that the computer can recognize the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. This would mean that there is no way to hide your emotions. For example, two friends get in an argument because one person was jealous of the other one. In most cases, that jealous person could have hidden his or his emotions, but with the new technology, the other person will know. Sometimes, it is a good thing to be able to hide emotions and feelings from other people.

Using technology that can read students' emotional expressions is not a good idea. For one, it is most likely a computer will not do a better job at teaching students than a human teacher. Also, computer cannot show empathy to someone who is going through a tough time. Last but not least, this technology programmed to be helpful could unintentionally end friendships or relationships. Computers may be useful in many cases, but they can never really do as much as humans.          ","

F-M141,"Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to bad until there comes a day where you want no one knowing how you're feeling. In the article, the author explains what this technology can do. So far, the article does a job identifying your emotional expressions, ""according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I am against the value of using this technology to read students thoughts or feelings. There are days when you want your own thougths and feelings kept to yourself, privacy, and as well as being able to learn something new everyday.

There come days when you don't want peope knowing how you're feeling and for some odd technology to just assume your feelings is just not adding up to me. The article shows a picture of the young Mona Lisa sort of smiling. Yes, he doesnt seem to happy, but is he? Only he knows. I dont agree with the computer system judging his feelings. ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfull, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto 1). To me, he looks like he's being forced to smile but like I said, only he knew his feelings while the picture was being taken. I don't believe that should be a thing, no one should be told how they are feeling. If we as humans dont really have a reason to judge, why should technology be able to.

Along with that, the article talks about ""a classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 1). Recognizing it could allow teachers to change their lessons, due to students being bored. How come? Daily there are students who complain about how boring a class is. No one forces them to come. Students come to school to learn, we don't expect to have fun. If a technology were to let teachers know when students were bored they'd be changing subjects seconds, by seconds. Students in that case, would be happy to act bored just for the sake of it. Less learning would accure if it were for the technology to detect kids who don't care about school who are constantly ""bored"". No one said school is fun, but neither should a technology detecting students feelings should get in the way of learning.

In the meantime, we have trouble understanding people. To allow a technology to have the power to easily understand thoughts, feelings of us humans is just critical. Allowing a technology to determine your friend's feelings is overrated according to my calculations. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisly enough to convey specific emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I don't believe something so ordinary could barge in and make us feel disturbed knowing not someone but something knows the way we're feeling.

Therfore, I am against this value of using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions. I believe there are different types of people in this world. There are days where you don't want to share your feelings to people, so why technology. If we are willing to share our thoughts, we will. Not have something so unusal do that job for us.                                                ","

F-M142,"To just put it bluntly, the Electoral College is a huge waste of time and pointless processing. It is completely unfair to the voters, who most of the time feel as if they're voicing their opinion for no reason since it doesn't even get taken into consideration. The whole concept of the electoral college in it's entirety is irrational.

Some people want to be part of this country and participate in one of it's biggest most known events, choosing the president but with the electoral college in our way like a stone wall preventing us from voicing our opinions makes it slightly impossible. Although I must state that the Electoral College does help avoid run-off elections according to source 3 by Richard A. Posner, parahgraph 22. This country is practically split into halves, meaning if two canidates won by popular vote but each had around the same percentage of votes the Electoral College would choose an obvious winner avoiding run-off elections and not complicating things further. That still doesn't change the fact of how unfair it is to the voters.

""Abolish the electoral college!"" said by Bob Dole in source 2 by Bradford Plumer. Yes I agree, abolish it, tear it down to smithereans, bury it into the ground never to resurface again. The electoral college is like planning a family trip, the youngest brother wants to go to Ohio while his brother wants to go to California, they tell the oldest brother of these two location ideas and the brother goes off telling the dad to go to New York, completely ignoring the other two suggestions. In this scenario the two youngest children are the citizens while the oldest brother is the electoral college, thus making the electoral college irrational, injustice, and unfair. It can be argued that the electoral college does help in some aspects like the certainty of outcome described in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, paragraph 18. But some certainty doesn't go a long way, there can be various faults in this certainty.

In my very argued opinion the electoral college is an outdated system usually old men like to stick to because they're afraid of change. Change is good, especially change that can pave the way to choosing better presidents and giving citizens more of a voice in our country, some of us just need a little nudging. Get rid of this annoying process, in with the new and out with the old.                                                                                                            ","

F-M143,"There was one cloudy morning in a Monday afternoon. The day was a busy day. It came to Tamala's (one of Professer's scientists) attention about the ""The Face on Mars"". He showed the scientist, Professer Lryc while he was observing a sick frog, new high-resoultion images and 3D altmetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.

""What is this that you are showing me?"", said Professer Lyrc

""Well, said Tamala. This is Viking photos from a Mars Global surveyor from 1976, 1998, 2001.""

Professer looks puzzled. It came to his attention that he learned about this from college. He remembers that he did a project on this long time ago.

""Very interesting, said Professer. I think we should have a discussion about this.""

""You think."", said Tamela

""Yes, because this is very interesting.""

So, Tamela called everyone to come to the court room to discuss the interesting news.

"" Ms.Tamela, I was really trying to get my project over with."", said Niguel

"" No time for that right now Niguel, said Professer. We have some business to discuss. Now Ms. Tamela has some business to tell you. And it is very interesting.""

""So, you know I was looking all over the internet about Mars, said Tamela. And I have found this."" Tamela struggles to turn the projector on. After a couple of seconds it show the photos. The visitors were looking surprised and confused.

""That looks familar."" said Niguel.

""Very familar. Is it the...the...um?', Sam hesatated.

""Face on Mars?"", said Dave.

""Yes, it is. Thanks Dave. said Tamela. So I've called everyone here because...I believe this is real."" Everyone gasp.

"" How can you prove that, Ms. Tamela."", said Professer.

""Well, Professer, Tamela explains. Twenty-five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's VIking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its brother ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called...Cydonia.""

""Wow, so that's what you researched."", said Professer.

"" Basically, Tamela said. The ""Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio shows, even haunted grocery checkout lines for 25 years!""

""Oh really."", said Professer.

""Some people think the Face is ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rater hide."", said Tamela.

Professer looks surprised. "" Any final words. Because I have a class in four minutes."", said Professer.

""Oh, what the picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around th American West. That's what I've learned.""

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M143 / There was one cloudy morning in a Monday afternoon. The day was a busy day. It came to Tamala's (one of Professer's scientists) attention about the ""The Face on Mars"". He showed the scientist, Professer Lryc while he was observing a sick frog, new high-resoultion images and 3D altmetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.

""What is this that you are showing me?"", said Professer Lyrc

""Well, said Tamala. This is Viking photos from a Mars Global surveyor from 1976, 1998, 2001.""

Professer looks puzzled. It came to his attention that he learned about this from college. He remembers that he did a project on this long time ago.

""Very interesting, said Professer. I think we should have a discussion about this.""

""You think."", said Tamela

""Yes, because this is very interesting.""

So, Tamela called everyone to come to the court room to discuss the interesting news.

"" Ms.Tamela, I was really trying to get my project over with."", said Niguel

"" No time for that right now Niguel, said Professer. We have some business to discuss. Now Ms. Tamela has some business to tell you. And it is very interesting.""

""So, you know I was looking all over the internet about Mars, said Tamela. And I have found this."" Tamela struggles to turn the projector on. After a couple of seconds it show the photos. The visitors were looking surprised and confused.

""That looks familar."" said Niguel.

""Very familar. Is it the...the...um?', Sam hesatated.

""Face on Mars?"", said Dave.

""Yes, it is. Thanks Dave. said Tamela. So I've called everyone here because...I believe this is real."" Everyone gasp.

"" How can you prove that, Ms. Tamela."", said Professer.

""Well, Professer, Tamela explains. Twenty-five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's VIking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its brother ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called...Cydonia.""

""Wow, so that's what you researched."", said Professer.

"" Basically, Tamela said. The ""Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio shows, even haunted grocery checkout lines for 25 years!""

""Oh really."", said Professer.

""Some people think the Face is ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rater hide."", said Tamela.

Professer looks surprised. "" Any final words. Because I have a class in four minutes."", said Professer.

""Oh, what the picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around th American West. That's what I've learned.""

""Okay, round of applause.""

Everyone claps. Tamela really gave some good interesting news.    ]""

F-M144,"I'm going to type an essay about an arugement for this technology to read students emotional expressions. The newest software update is called Facial Action Coding System. I really feel like this type of technogoly would be really helpful.

There is a lot of prons and cons to this technogoly because some students may not want you to know how they are feeling or what there emtions are, I feel as if some students need the help or may feel, let's say lonely but don't like saying they are so they fake a smile but those are the students who really need someone to know. So I'm going ot start out in my first paragraph saying why I think it would be good to have this type of system.

My first paragraph is going to be my first reason why I feel that it would help and a little bit about the software. The software update has promising applications for a variety of industries. The computer constrcuts a 3-D computer model of the face all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. I feel that it will help a lot more with young teenagers in our generation.

A lot of people in our generation are going through depression and they don't like to telling people about it, so if you have this software it would help kids from sucide thoughts or some things like that.

Another reason why it woud be helpful is because you could use it on anyone not just students. My first reason why I think it would be a brillant idea would be an example such as this, if you went to class one day and seen your friend upset you would be able to look at his and know shes upset but if you asked his and he said no I'm fine, he would be lying. If you had this software update and you used it on your friend it would say he is 70 percent upset and 30 percent mad. So now you know he is upset most of the time and you could change that by talking about things with his letting his parents know. Little things like that could change someones life forever.

My last reason I think it would be helpful is because you would know how everyones feeling. The Mona Lisa is to demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showoing how much a computer can do. It also says in paragraph 6 that ""

A classroom computer could recogonize when a student is becoming bored or confused"". That could also help the teacher out a lot. Some students don't always let the teacher know if they are bored or confused because maybe they are scared or embarssed, but now your teacher would know if you were confused about something. He would be able to help you or do something a little more exciting.

My conclusion paragraph is going to wrap up my essay. As I said in the introduction I think this would be a really good idea for this software update to be in classrooms for teacher and students. I think it would help with teenagers. I gave a couple reasons why I would want this software update or why it would help. I have seen a lot of students falling asleep in class and the teacher just keeps going. I have also been one of those students were I'm really confused but I don't want to say in front of the class so I either don't say anything or I say something to my buddy next to me. Those are my reasons why I am for this Facial Action Coding System.                  ","

F-M145,"Technology can be good uses for a lot of things in life espiecally for emotional,mental,and physical reasons. Technology has came a long way for many years and it becomes better every single day. Some people think technology is a bad thing but it actually does a lot for people and different sitautions in life. Expression can increase your emotion just as simple as a smile or a quick laugh.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could help improve someones emotional state by quickly seeing what their emotions are and if they are feeling down you can give them a hug and increase their emotions. If the Facial Action Coding System was a real life tool we could see many changes in peoples behaviors as well. Having a good behavior can make a good impact on your life and also a good reputation. The world can be seen as a different place if we all have good behaviors and good emotions because people will be a lot respectful and mindful of other human beings.

If someone used the Facial Action Coding System on other artist's pictures they could see how they felt at the time during the picture. Back when Mona Lisa got his picture taken he could have expierenced many emotions and no one truly knew how he was feeling but now that there is technology people easily can tell how he truly felt. As of today many people are left in their feelings and they don't know how to talk about their problems so they just keep them inside. With the technology it would help a lot of people express their feelins without feeling embarassed or scared. ","

F-M146,"The Mona Lisa's mood was never really made out to be one emotion.Looking at this painting would have anyone confused as to what was running through he r mind at that exact moment or what was going on around his.Leonardo da Vinci captured what seems to be a smirk or even a face of mixed emotions.

The Mona Lisa is known for having a multi-expression face,but in this day in age it can be determined by people all over the world exactly what he felt in that exact moment. ""He's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry...It's the subject of Leonardo di Vinci's Renaissance painting,Mona Lisa--at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" With this new amazing software it will be easier to read people and use this to analyze different types of people.

This advanced technology works much like us.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday.For instance,you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his face''. Not only can this new tech help with human expressions,but this software can also help with education. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This new discovery can help the avarage student through a stressful and confusing class meaning grades would go up and students would be more succsesful in their acadimic career.

Finally,this technology can change the education world and everything else for the better.Making everything easier and stressless to the world.","

F-M147,"The author emphasis how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is very important to Astronomers. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" mainly supports how Venus is worth the riskand challenge to explore to see if it's as much like Earth as it's said to be, because it is close to Earth in size and density, has similiar geographics, and is known as Earth's brother planet.

First, Venus is set up with similar distancing as Earth it's sometimes often referred to as ""Earth's twin"". The text says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Venus is so similar to Earth, but yet so challenging to explore.

Second, just like Earth Venus has mountains and valleys. Some might even say long ago there were oceans, because the text says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth.""

Then, Venus is known to be Earth's brother planet! Venus has always been the closest planet to Earth other than Mars, but if Venus is so much like Earth astronomers can't figure out why it's so much more inhospitable than Earth.

In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging place to see and be. Venus has not been touched in more than 30 years! In the text it says "".. not a singlr spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" So although Venus is the brother of Earth astronomers know very little about his.

F-M148,"Dear Senator,

I believe the way the American Goverment is run is injust and outdated. I believe this because the way we as America elect a new president is unfair to many people.

The reason I say that is the electoral college is unjust is 538 people should'nt be voting for more than a billion people. The way I believe our new President should be selected is by a majority rule, which ever Canidate has the most votes should win not based off people who vote for our state we live in. Even though the majority of the time the representative from his or his state votes depending on the popular vote from there state, but the reason im saying this is that he or he has the power to pick whatever he or he wants. Also another reason would be that the people only vote for a slate whether it be democratic or republic people in the slate can just change there mind and pick a differnt side. I would understand this system before our time but now we have so much technology people can vote from anywhere they dont have to go put a paper in a box anymore. The system is outdated and unfair to many people. Some people would argue against the point that the representative votes depending on his or his states popular vote, but there has been and will be more of the representative picking against his state if it stays like this.

If this actually ever does get to you I hope you take into consideration some of the points I have given you. Like I said before the Electoral College system is outdated and unfair.    ","

F-M149,"Driveless cars are coming isn't that great? What will the world be without drivers? Are their going to be people who will forget how to drive? Or is driving going to become an unnatural part of the human society?

The idea of having cars that drive by themselves seems wonderful. Personally I'm against that were going to have driveless cars. For example if one day the system fails, who are we going to blame.? Also whos going to be at fault, and how are the damags going to be solved or payed for. Througout time soon this will become a conterversial deal.

Secondly, are people just going to forget how to be independent and drive, or are they going to start relying on a computer to make all their decesions? As a driver myself I would'nt like a car taking me places without taking a hold of the wheel. Just imagine a driveless car will take all the enthusiasum out of driving.

Lastly, since technology is getting so advanced now in days and hackers are also coming along with the cyber world, the chances of getting kidnapped or fraud can increase. For example, lets say that a person needs to go somewhere by taxi. The taxi picks that person up and takes his to the correct destination, and when the time comes to pay he pulls out his debit card and swipes it. But instead of taking the correct amount a hacker takes all the money from his debit card. That again is fraud. Or lets say the instead of the driverless car taking his home, it drives out to an unkown part of the city and shes never seen again. Thats a perfect example of kidnapping. Therefore the security system will also have to increase.

In concluion, this technology would be great have abd a very useful tool that people can use. But it can aslo become an issue with society bringing up many issues. Especially if some people are going to try an use it for the bad. I would recommened to limit the time that would use driverless cars.","

In concluion, this technology would be great have abd a very useful tool that people can use. But it can aslo become an issue with society bringing up many issues. Especially if some people are going to try an use it for the bad. I would recommened to limit the time that would use driverless cars.]""

F-M150,"Our population is booming and with it, our car industry. Cars have provided us with mulitple pros for example, getting us places more quickly, and transportation of goods and services is more efficient. We have to know though that with every good follows a bad, and our beloved cars might not be as great as we belive them to be! Pollution from cars has affected our enviornment severley, we have thousands of accidents daily, and we are stressed due to traffic congestion and daily driving. So, limitting car usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out.

Our enviornment has been infected with toxic greenhouse gasses, and carbon emmisions which comes from our cars' tailpipes. Mixed with rain, the pollution causes a heavy smog making it nearly impossible for people to even see what is right in front of them making it very dangerous. We are now forced to hold days where no one is able to use their own cars because the pollution is so bad. Arturo Plaza explains that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. (Par 24)"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy how much better it is living in a cleaner enviornment! It is much healthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. He explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drasitcally reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. (Par 5)"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Everyday we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so why add on any more? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on how other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substancioully. Heirun Walter is a civialian in a town with no car usage. He explains that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. (Par 3)"" Even though he is a father of two and a media trainer, he is able to live a life less stressed without his own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard with out them having to worry about the passing cars. Heidrun Walter explains that he can walk down the streets where the  sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. ( Par 3)""

We can help ourselves and our enviornment by limitng our car usage daily! Limiting usuage could provide us with many advantages because our enviornment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stresssed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be healthier, and live a better life.            ","

F-M151,"cars, they wernt invented in the old days. who needs them, not me. screw cars. Ill tell u what u need to know about life and transportation. We can limit car use if u just use this information and use it in your life.

paris has so much smog. Ew!!! No one likes that so lets limit car use. paris has 147 micrograms of matter in cubic meter measurement. Dang taxes! I hate soccer dads, my dad is one so i cant hate them too much. All they do is drive everywhere and use up all the resources so there kid can strike out in little leauge! Now i will tell you how to fix this problem.

if some of the stupid soccer dads driving around there rolling egg (mini van) the car use would be cut in half. Then you might say then what is my little kid going to do. You can read a biycle places just like it said in line 24 of ""car-free day spinning into a big hit bogota. Now ill tell you what kind of bike and what your gonna do with it and your gonna love it!

A bmx bike is what im talking about. you can transportate it to the skatepark to ride the ramps. Its really fun and i love it. Those gas using Mini vans would be off the streets and bmx bikes can take over. Think about our earth for once please.

well to conclude things up car use is oversused highly. It is mainly the soccer dads fault. To fix all the problems in the world everyone needs to get a bmx bike and go ride some dirt jumps and this world would be a happier place!!!    ","

F-M152,"I disagree with this use of technology beacause i think we are relying too much on tech. Today we use so much technology that we are taking a test on a computer that used to be on paper! I worry that if we were to have a nationwide powersurge we'd be sitting ducks. but a couple decades earlier I think we could have been alright. When you are talking with someone you shouldn't rely on tech to tell you how they're feeling, personally I think it's inhumane. I should be able to look at someone and by they're expression (which the computer reads) I myself alone should be able to tell what they are feeling, and if not then you can ask them with your words like a human being would. We aren't robots we don't need to ask siri how are loved ones are feeling. It completely takes away the joys of bonding and in the case of mona lisa, the elegance of mystery. I personally love art and portraits because it's fun to try and figure out what they are thinking and then ask someone else what they think because that person might have a different idea. Using technology would take away peoples idea to different veiw points of the same portrait. I think we should rely on ourselves to figure out what mona lisa is thinking. Personally to me, he looks like a caring guardian kind of man, maybe a father or loved one. Going back the text says he was 83% happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, and 2%angry. I say it's 100% up to you. In the case of the students what if the picture is taken when they blink? Or if they sneeze? Jane could be having a really sad day and the picture could be taken at the worng moment and say he was ecstatic. You can rely on tech for these readings you need to read them face to face. Ask them how they are feeling, don't just run up and snap a pic. In conclusion, use your words and ask how someone is feeling!","

F-M153,"Have you ever wondered what venus is like? Well studying venus can be very dangerous with its carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, extremely high temperature and more. Even though it can be dangerous it is a worthy pursuit. Studying venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our brother planet, we are very curious about it, and human can survive venus conditions.

Venus is known as Earths brother planet but we don't know much about it and have never attempted going there. Venus is Earths brother planet because the text talks about how venus is the cloest planet to earth based on size and density. Also Venus has features like vlley, mountains, and craters like earth does and Venus shows that it was most likely covered in oceans long ago and could of supported various life forms. This is why we should explore venus because it is our brother planet

Human curiosity plays a big role into why we should explore Venus. Humans are very curious about the planet since it shows signs that life could of lived there. Also it resembles Earth so much that we want to know more about its geogrpahy. In general we want to know more about this planet and get up close to it and observe it directly instead of from a far. We also want to know what gases there are and so maybe we could build something that wouldn't melt when it lands. This is how human curtiosity plays a role in discovering Venus.

Venus also is a worthy pursuit becuase the text states the temperature is 170 degrees and it states humans can survive on this planet. So even though the temperature and atmosphere seem very dangerous it is worth the exploration because humans can survive so with proper training we could explore Venus. The article also talks about NASA building something to get 30 feet off of Venus so if we can get that close then eventually we will be able to get on the planet.

In conclusion Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it shows many dangers. We can overcome those dangers and make traveling to Venus less dangerous. Since its our brother planet it is worth exploring to find more out about our own planet even. Our human curiosity makes us want to explore Venus in more depth. Also humans can survive on it so with new technology and training they can travel there and be safe. This is why traveling to Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our brother planet, we are curious about it, and humans can already survive on it.       ","

F-M155,"No, this new technology is not useful at all because theres no need for a computer telling you how you should feel. How could a machine that doesnt have feeling detect how you are feeling even humans have trouble detecting thatand we have feelings. In a classroom this wouldnt be helpful because its not helping them in school with anything. That is what student want is help in school subjects not their feeling that we ahve friend and family to talk to not som random computer. Most of the time the computer would be wrong because someone could depressed with a happy face on.

In paragraph 1 it says that they tested this on a painting. How could the computer make a 3D model of the face on a picture that it flat. The information that is givin couldn't be accurate at this point. Also he had a strait face in the picture how could he be 83 percent happy if he showed no emotion in the original picture painted. Also, in paragraph 5 in lines 4 and 5 is says that they had to add to the picture so the computer could pick up the face and tell them what he was feeling.

In conclusion this would no be useful at all because its a computer that doesn't have any type of emotions or feeling trying to tell you what you are feeling. Every person has a different face and everyone has different feelings and thats hard for even a computer to understand. Humans have trouble identifying these feeling because no one knows what someone else is feeling except themselves. No computer in the world could tell you what you are feeling. Even if they do have this crazy sofware that they think might work.","

F-M156,"techonology called the ficial Action coding System enavles computer to identify human emotions is really good thing. we would like to know If they are lying about their emotional. Dr. Huang is really smart but I think he is right.

First,computer to identify human emotions is really good thing because we would know If they are lying to us or no. Acoording the text "" can we actually ""calculate""emotions like math homework"",I think they got the right point because our emotional is like calculate. They have to calculate are we really sad or happy. Another example from the text"" The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". I Hope our school should do like that so people we could help other people whenever we are sad.

Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. Honestly, I used to cheat on my boyfriend too back in the day but the good part is that we don't know facial action yet. If we both know that time I bet he will say"" let do this because I want If you are cheating on me"". Still right now he don't know that I cheat on his but we are already broke tho. I saw on social media a lot Boyfriend and boyfriend did that. When they know they both got cheating,both of them feel wierd. People is really good at hide thing I hope we are did Facial Action so we could know how is lying or nah.

Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing."" The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF

lllinois.""Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say"" I want to meet with Dr. Huang"".

F-M158,"I wouldnt use this Facial Action Coding System on students because it those enables computers to dentify humans emotions but not real ones, it just shows the human emmotions byt the expression but not the real emotion that the human is feelin, Mona Lisa's natural face might be like that but not because the Facial Action Coding System identified that he has several different emotions showing in that paint from Da Vinci means that he was for real feeling those emotions, I think that is just how his face is , because all the people in this planet have dufferent faces that we cant not even describe if they feeling this or that because there face is just like that, But sometimes its true the Facial Action Coding System might be true because Dr. Huang observed that Da Vinci has studied anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

I t says that the same technology can make computer animated faces more exoressive.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System works perfectly good and does indentify humans expression like Dr. Haung said but not real emotion becasue the person can just be expressing some emotions but that doesn't mean they feeeling it that way.    ","

F-M159,"I do believe that the use of this technology is and will be extremely valuable.

Some evidence to support why i believe this type of technology could be very valuable is that in the first sentence the article states""He's 83% happy, 9 % desgusted,6% fearful and 2% percent happy. This means that advanced technology can find out all if that information about human emotions and possibly more and it is as easy as calculating homework.This type of technology can also be useful and valuable becasue a situation could be where someone can't express thier emotions, or doesn't know how to express their emotions.That's where FACS come in,(Facial Action Coding System).Also too add to me agreeing that this technology could be very valuable, the Facial Action Coding System was used on Mona Lisa. He never smiles, it's very rare you catch his doing it. So who knows his emotions.

To add to my reasoning the Facial Action Coding System can also be useful is because students in classrooms expressions be so blank, all you can assume is that the students dont wanna be there. But what if there's more to it? What if behind those blank faces is a whole world of emotons,im pretty sure everybody has emotions.Some people love showing them. Some are shy to show them,and others just dont know.But they can know with FACS. It starts with a 3-D computer model of the face that shows the 44 major muscles.FACS has 6 basic emotions,happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

So to conclude my argument i do believe this tye of technology can be very valuble in students classroom because all students has emotion, just some have a hard way of showing them.FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System. It is a new software that has ben developed to shows the basic six emotions of human emotions.Which was modeled on The Mona Lisa.And according to the new software he is 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful,2% angry. How weird is that someone who rarley smiles is 83% happy. That just proves that this technology could make this world a better place.","

F-M160,"The technology used in the story is valuable while it reads facial structure, it can evenpin point what exspetion Mona lisa has. They can figure out what he has by the computers information.

First, the calculations that this computer has made is reflecting on his facial features. Paragraph 1 says, ""He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Tis shows how the computer calculates to his facial features depending on muscle in the face. In paragraph 3 it states,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

Second, the desciption of this software take out different inits of emotions by you face structure, In paragraph 4 it states, "" The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements, in a real face or in painting face of Mona lisa. By weighing in different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions"".This shows how the device works and what is exactly calculates.

Finally, the many ways the computer claculates your facial structure depends on how you feel. In paragraph 6 it states,""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". This shows how the demonstration of Mona Lisa makes a person feel happy and how they choose to mrket their product. Pragraph 6 also states,"" The same technology can make compuer animated faces more expressive"". This shows how they could furtther their computer development.

This computer is valuable and helps people figure out how people are feeling. The computer will be a good peice of equipment on the market is it is able to be used by proffessions and teachers.","

The last reason is that you would be able to have free time to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime.

F-M162,"Yes i think that the technolody to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom is valuble. One reason why i feel like this is a good diea is because it lets you help the student out if they are deprssed or something. Because not alot of students may not say anything because they dont want their business out there in public. And iIf you use this technology then youll be able to come talk to that student 1on1 as a techer face to face to solve the problems they they are delaing

with.

Its basically a 3-D computer model that scans your whole face. And all 44 major muscles in the model must must move the exact same just like human muscles should. It has 6 basic emotions which are happines,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness. So its like a software and you scan your face and it shows your emotions and you are basically having the human traits when

it comes down to

emotions.

Us humans preform the same task when it comes to trying to paint sculptures of peope and paintings.

For example Mona LIsa he was a human that alot of people know about because of the well known Painter Da Vinci ended up making a famous painting of his. His painting made alot of people smile when they seen his cause it showed different types of emotions when looking at his.

But now people are starting to benfit the future as technology is only going to improve as we live life. For example say that you smile when a web ad appears on your screen because it may be something that you are interrested in. But alos say that what if a different type of ad shows up and then you have a sad or different type of expressin or emotion. Then the screen will go to a different ad because it bascially scaneed your face. And it seen how you reacted so it made up some changes.

But if i was to judge i think this is a good use of technology. aAd i feel like we could use this not only in a psoitve way. But to help benefit the next geneartion of people in the future. ","

F-M163,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a man gets into a taxi and imputs his destination, he is entrusting his life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This man liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending his into a ditch. He liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this man did get to his destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.","

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M163 / In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

F-M164,"Do the computers tell people emotions or what they think? why does the mona Lisa smile make people smile? There are three facts bout why the can not tell emotions or expressions.

The first piece of evidence is there are six different type of emotions and the software would not be able to figure them all out. The six types of emotiond are happyiness, sadiness, angry, disgust, fear and suprised(Dr. Paul Eckman). i believe that computers cant tell if the software can tell whether or not if people have the right or any emotion at all.

In the fourth paragraph Dr. Huang states that "" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" (Dr. Huang) ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions""( like not smiling broadly).I agree, each individual has their own exprssion that can happen anytime.

The Mona Lisa makes people smile because of how interesting the expression is on his face and how you dont know how he feels. Mona Lisa could be mad, happy, sad, scared, worried, any of these emotions can express how he feels in the painting.

The auther that wrote this artice is stating that software may or may not understand if you have emotions or any expressions. it can not tell because the software is not alive to tell if you are in a mood or not.","

F-M165,"I think the computer the students are using to identify human emotions is valuable. It could useful for many things in the world or can use for important uses like if people are lying. This techology could be helpful to scientists for many uses or like in the article says for identify paints or surgeries. In the following paragraghs i will give my reason why its a good reason to the FACS and evidenece.

The reason i agree that they should have the FACS is because it could be used for alot of things like see who is confused or lost, and if someone is lying when they are introuble, and even if they need it for a painting like this artcle. I think people always questioned if mona lisa is happy or mad, or even confused. In the artricle on paragraph 3 it says that the computer can classifi if someone or some painting is happy, sad, anger, fear, and disgusted. So what they did is they made the painting 3-d and scanned his face to see what was his emotions were during da vinci was painting and also it says that the computer can also major 44 muscles on our face and can tell if we are happy or sad. on paragraph 1 the result of what emotion mona lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful andf 2% angry. this result could be right or just what the computer thinks what his emotion was in that very moment da vinci was painting his.

In conclusion i do think FACS is valuable because it could help figuring out emotions on people in paintings like da vinci, help during surgery, help the teacher know if people did understand the lesson or not, and help people know who is lying or not.","

F-M166,"I am strongly against driverless cars. I feel that whoever came up with the idea must have had some bad food or something. I wonder what encouraged them to even have the thought of a car driving itself. Having driverless cars will most likely end the human population. I am saying this because it makes me think of the movie Wall-e.

In the movie Wall-e there is a robot named Wall-e and earth is deserted or so wall-e thinks. One day Wall-e was doing his normal routine when he stumbled upon a pretty robot named Eve. Wall-e and Eve go on a journey to find his home/ ship, and when they do it is filled with humans. Wall-e is suprised to see the humans he thought they all were dead. Every human that he sees is sitting in a chair that can move them aournd to where ever they want, and get them whatever they want. They don have to get up for anything or physically move their musles. All of the people are obese. People die from obesity, obesity can cause heart problems which can cause a heart attack. Which can make you die. This is only a chair, imagine what it would be like if it was a car.

It would be pointless for adults and teenagers to get lisence. It would be pointless to have rules of the road. Everything that has restriictions, or policies on drivers and their driving would be pointless and useless. As of now we our try to stop drinking and driving. If a car drove itself few crashes but the number lives that are taken will be the same. Peopel can die from alcohol poisoning. Even now cars have malfunctions, what if the driverless car runs into another car because it couldnt stop. A few years ago a mentleman was on the interstate and his breaks weren't working. The emergency break wasn't even working, and he was going aroung 70 miles per hour. He only had control over the steering wheel. People wont have control over the steering wheel of the driverless car descides to malfunction. Many lives could be taken because of it. This is why i am against driverless cars.   ","

F-M167,"Normally in everyone's mind when they are a teenager they want to have a car to go to places such as the mall, beach, etc. There are advantages though to limiting car usage. The whole planet should really hear or read about it, it's amazing to what these advantages can do for you, others, and our ecosystem.

The first of many reasons why we should limit car usage is because of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of gas emissions in Europe. . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States(Source 1)."" This just shows the evidence by the future if this keeps going like this the Whole entire planet would be all polluted which would make living conditions harder than they have to be. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and father of two states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way(Source 1)."" Looking at this quote tells me that he must have been stressed with the car, maybe it was because of the traffic or the gas bill who knows, but he does feel happier without it so he must feel more at ease that his area is not cramped up with cars. In Vauban, Germany if you own a car where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner must buy a space, for $40,00, along with a home. Well sign me up with a bike or running shoes because I don't have that kind of money to spend just to live in a area with no cars.

Furthermore I would like to go to Paris, but sources state that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals(Source 2)."" Reuters had found 147 micrograms of particulate matter or PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. That is pretty bad and knowing that people say that you must go to Paris, yeah sure for I can get polluted air into my system got it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since Frtance has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" According to Reuters ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe(Source 2)."" Even Bogata, Columbia has a ""Car-free day"" and if you don't follow the rules of car-free day you will be fined $25. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he and his husband rode a two-seat bicycle with his husband(Source 3).

It is just clear that most areas in the world are trying to change the way we live our lives for the sake of all human life. It is a good oppurtunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution as the source stated before. So the next time you want a car think to yourself ""Which one is much more helpful to the planet's ecosystem?""    ","

F-M168,"Technology to read emotional expression of students in the classroom is valuable? Is technology in classrom good for students for teacher can read there emotions. I think it would be good to hvae them in classrooms. Teachers should have them so they can read studets emotions. Here are my three reasons why teachers hsould have technology to read emotional expressions.

If the students like the teacher or any other students. If the teacher uses the technology on the students he can tell rather or not if the students likes his. If the students dont like the teacher can at least try to make that student like his. The teacher can tell if the student is going to give the teacher a bdad time by the teacher emotions.

I mean thats good to know because the teacher can know what student going to give his a bad time.

The students are in a bad mood or something or they getting bullied by a classmate. The teacher can know by using that technology on the student. If the student is in a bad mood the teacher can sit down with that students and talk to what student bully him. I think the teacher would find out more which students would catch the bullys. I think that technology would be grate for a school.

I think it could help the teachers know if the students would get that material. Like if they dont get it the teacher can use that technology and know if that student dont get. The teachers would ask that student if the students lie the teacher can use the technology. I think that would be great the teacher can help the student more.

Those are my reasons why technology of emotional expression should be in the classroom. Those are my three reasons why.","

F-M170,"Exploring Venus is just as important as Exporing the solar system. Venus is Earth twin brother in the terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.

Exploring Venus would help us better understand more about our solar system and even our galaxy. With Venus being just like Earth in terms like density and size it would be fun to explore Venus but also Venus isnt that far from us. But by better understanding Venus would help our space techology improve greatly. With better understanding of Venus will better our konwledge not only of our solar system but our galaxy.

Venus has a thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for us because carbon dioxide is gas element which traps heat that the sun gives to all the planet in our solar system and with Venus atmophere being mostly carbon. Most heat is trap in Venus atmosphere with little escaping with all that heat that is trap it the tempiture on Venus is very hot even for our spacecraft. But despike this exploring VENus is still a good thing because long ago Venus was once a Earth-like planet just like his twin brother Earth.

Despite the challenge that Venus is giving us we will find a way to get past the acid clouds and the thick carbon dioxid atmosphere because through out human history we have had many challenge as a species but we have proven that we are more than comble of over coming this types of challenges. One day we will get to Venus and we will learn about his because human curiosity always win. No matter how challenging it is we will overcome it. By us finlly understanding Venus will as a species will better our understanding not only our solar system but our galaxy as well.","

F-M171,"Me being a young teenager and only being in highschool, I feel as if we should keep the Electoral College. Reasons being, if we change too the election by popular vote, citizens are going too choose the president they like, the president that they think will change things, and the president that they think looks best. So of course the citizens are going too choose that particular president just so that president can get the most votes and become president.

Changing too the most popular vote will not be the best idea because, citizens are going too choose the president that they like regardless if the president is good or not so good. If us citizens that are voting like the president, then chances are, we're going too vote for him or his. Not only are we going too vote for him or his, were also going to tell our friends too vote for them also so the president can get the most likes and get elected. With the Electoral College, the votes have to go through a process and then the election goes from there.

Chances being with the most popular election is, we're going too get a not soo good president elected as our president. Most people think that if they choose the ""right"" president, then things are going too change when thats not true. People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say ""well, I only his/him for them because he/he looked as if he/he could change things."" Just because he/he LOOKS like they could change something, doesn't mean its going too happen. That's where the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes in.

I've heard many people say ""I voted for such and such as president because he/he looks best."" In an election for president, looks do not matter what so ever. The president could be handsome or gorgeous and be the worst president in the United States and/or the president could be ugly and be the best president. In a president election, no one is going too care about the looks of the president. We're going too care about the person being voted for president, outlook on things as being the president. A lot comes with being a president and the looks surely aren't one of the things. In my personal opinion, if you're voting for the looks, then maybe you shouldnt be voting at all.

There's many reasons on why we shouldnt change too the most popular vote election and why we should just stay with the Electoral College. The most popular vote election would not be the smartest idea of voting for president and honestly, in my opinion, I feel as if the Electoral College is best. Who would want a president being president because they got the most votes for being liked, voted because their the right president, or voted because they look the best? Truth be told, that's probably the worst thing too change too. With that being said, lets stick too the Electoral College.    ","

F-M172,"I think that we should keep the Electoral college rule. This is simply because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have always used this rule in all of our elections for presidents. Also because it is win or take all in this process wizard mean if the canidate gets a majority of the votes then he or he gets the votes for that state.

I think we should keep the Electoral college this is because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have been going by this rule for all of our past elections and for all of our winning canidates. we have never changed or strayed off from this rule why should we all of the sudden change it? I do not think we should change it because some people disagree with it. You can have your own opinion about it but i do not think just because of someone's opinion we should change what we have been doing for many years before them.

Also i think we should not change this because it has helped us for so long to help elect the president. As in if he or he gets a majority of the votes for that state the they get all the votes for that state. It is a win or take all position. This also allows the people to have a vote and say of who the president should be and who they want it to be.

I understand why alot of people disagree with the Electoral college rule though. This is because the voters who do not get a majority rule do not have a vote in who will be president. This makes people angry and upset because there vote does not matter and will not mean anything if the other people get the pa    ","

In this section of this draft theses were the best surpporting deatils to explain information about the authour claim.

In paragraph 5 the author tells readers about NASA

and this paragraph explains that NASA is trying to come up with an soultion to the conditions on surface of Venus and that would allow scientists to float above the fray. This is important because the atomsphere of venus is very strong compared to earth and mars atomsphere and that puts exploraers in danger. Also in paragraph 6 resceachers are trying to make better and improve machines that will surive on Venus. so that resacecher can get rocks, gas for the better knowledge for them to know more about venus.

The last supporting detal is thier is another project reseachers are trying to use to get more information about venus which is to use old technolgoy called "" mechanical computers"" these devices were frist made in the 18000s and played an important role during WW1 in the 1940s, these decives are important to the rescaechers because the computers makes calcualtions by using gears and levers and which doesnt require electronics,This is important because modern techenlogy is too strong today and is much more delicate but the machanical oarts of the old computers can be made more resistant to pressure heat and other forces on venus.

Becuase of the author cliam and deatil. Readers now the importance and struggles rescerachers go through to know more about venus. NASA should continue to study earths brother planet, also find a safer way for researchers to get on earth,for the importantce of everyones kownledge.     ","

F-M175,"Dear Senator,

We should abolish the electoral college. It nakes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college.

The electoral college is extremely biased on the canditates and the voters have only a miniscule chance to elect the right voter. The chance is so miniscule that even an atom couldn't fit through it. On the counterclaim that it could be a tie, which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? The canditates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, he/he already has 20% of the vote in his/his pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting canditates ""they"" think is best, not voting the canditates their state thinks is best.

To top it off, people are just so wooed by the canditate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a men who needed Obamacare for his ill son, yet he was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam.

A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country? After all these years of black equality and men's rights, we have decided to just completely ruin our entire form of government by being prejuice to other states. Yes, they may have a lesser population, but that doesn't mean anything. It just means that we are not giving people the right of suffrage.

Apparently, the electoral college elects a ""clear winner"", when the popular vote coiuld do that just fine on its own. Why do you think we have voting day for? I'm sure its so that the president that they didn't vote for was chosen by the elctoral college. Here's some logic, lets choose a selected number of people to vote for president instead of all of America. Isn't that a great idea.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their ""something"", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world.

Lords and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins.                                                            ","

We should abolish the electoral college. It nakes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college.

The electoral college is extremely biased on the canditates and the voters have only a miniscule chance to elect the right voter. The chance is so miniscule that even an atom couldn't fit through it. On the counterclaim that it could be a tie, which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? The canditates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, he/he already has 20% of the vote in his/his pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting canditates ""they"" think is best, not voting the canditates their state thinks is best.

To top it off, people are just so wooed by the canditate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a men who needed Obamacare for his ill son, yet he was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam.

A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country? After all these years of black equality and men's rights, we have decided to just completely ruin our entire form of government by being prejuice to other states. Yes, they may have a lesser population, but that doesn't mean anything. It just means that we are not giving people the right of suffrage.

Apparently, the electoral college elects a ""clear winner"", when the popular vote coiuld do that just fine on its own. Why do you think we have voting day for? I'm sure its so that the president that they didn't vote for was chosen by the elctoral college. Here's some logic, lets choose a selected number of people to vote for president instead of all of America. Isn't that a great idea.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their ""something"", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world.

Lords and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins.                                                            ]""

F-M176,"Facial Action coding is not useful i don't think technology can read someone's emotions because in paragragh 2 it states that ""how can a computer recoginize the subtle facial movements we humans use to ezpress how we feel"" so how can we technology read someone's emotions.

Can the Facial action coding really read how humans feel like how can you read how he/he feel just by looking at them in paragragh 4 it states that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"" if the computur compares your face to another one how do it really know how your feeling how is ti getting the presentages and is it really right about how you feel.

The computer can tell you how you look or how it looks like hoe you feeling but in a picture it probably look like how you feel but how do the computer really know how you feel after or before you took the picture. what if you just did a regular smile but you felt sad would the computer read that you are sad and not happy.

In the Mona LIsa it looks like he is happy in the first paragragh it states that ""he's 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearfuland 2 percent angry"" how do the computer know that he is angry how can a computer read the perfect percent of how you are feeling.

I think that people don't need a computer that can tell them how happy,sad or mad because that's their feelings so how do they know that they are feeling that way. In my opion only one person can tell you how happy or sad and mad you are is your self because those are your feelings and some people choose to express their feelings but some don't.","

F-M177,"Using technology to read a persons facial emotional expressions is really not a bad idea, just think about a computer being able to tell if your happy,sad,mad ect .In paragraph 1 it states all the emotions that the mona lisa had in the panting when most of the world had thought of his having one emotion,now to think that he acually had almost 5 different things going on in his face in the panting.

""most human communtion is nonverbal including emotional communcaton "" this is really cool becasue people in this time don't do a lot of talking,they most likeing have there face in a screen someone and if Dr. Hang decides to be more open with other companies like apple of samsang that i would be easier to tell what someone means though text or picture,becasue it really hard to decifier what someone truely means mean there not pyhsical there with you. Paragraph 8 says that this computer can tell if your putting on a true or false smile in other words if your telling a lie or not.

In conclusion Dr. hang has a truely great thing going on right now this could be a future in the next couple of years if technology it's any better that in is right now, small things like Dr. hang idea or invention can lead this world bigger and better.  ","

F-M178,"I think that this new software, the Facial Action Coding System is good idea and a really great system. Because me myself I have friends that will say there fine when I really know there and it and it would be really nice to have this just so your really knew how there are feeling. And I think its super smart that the system uses the 44 major muscles. One thing that I don't like about the system is that someone could use it on me and then someone. Like my dad could and would be able to tell when I'm not ok or when im upset. But I guess if I wanted this to use on my frinds then there is a down fall. And that would be the software could get into my dads hands, But hey you lose some and you win some. Over all I like it and wouldnt mind have it.","

F-M179,"The thought of a computer program being able to read emotions sounds very interesting at first. It almost makes a person feel like he or he are in a science fiction book set in the future. Though it may be interesting, that does not necessarily make it right. The truth of the matter is that though a computer program measuring how someone feels may be interesting, it is an invasion of privacy and teachers have no need to know a student's emotions while in class. The new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is an invasion of a student's privacy and is not necessary.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because of how invasive it is to a student's privacy. The text explained that the technology was able to determine that in the Mona Lisa painting the person being painted was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy. No one should be able to know to that great of a detail what another person is feeling without that person's premission. If a teacher wanted to know the emotions of his or his students, simply asking them how they feel is enough. Using that technology in a classroom crosses a boundry of privacy that many students would not be comfortable with. Many students would not feel at ease and safe being in the classroom knowing their emotions are being read.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is not necessary. In the text Dr. Huang, who works with the Facial Action Coding System technology, says that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Students and people in general are already communicating their emotions to the level that their emotions need to be communicated. When someone sees another person smiling, he or he knows that person is happy, or if someone sees a person frowning, he or he knows that person is sad. The text says the technology could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored to support that the technology could be beneficial in a classroom setting. But the truth of the matter is, if a teacher wants to know when his or his class is becoming confused or bored, all he or he would have to do is ask. That is why most teachers ask after a lesson, ""Does anyone have any questions?""

Not only that, but a teacher would not have to know if a student is happy or sad in the first place. The responsibility of a teacher is to teach and to ensure the students understand. A teacher does not need to know if his or his students are happy or sad. A school would be wasting its money to pay for a system that is not of necessity.

It is evident with all of the facts stacked against it, that Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in a classroom setting because of its invasiveness to student privacy and the lack of a need for it in a classroom. From the fact that knowing exactly everything students are feeling would make students uncomfortable, to the fact that a teacher could ask a student if he or he wanted to know how that student is feeling, it is clear this technology lacks value in a classroom setting. School administration and the community should ensure that this kind of technology never gets put in any classrooms. This would be a waste of money for the school corporation because of the lack of necessity for it. It would also make many students uncomfortable, which could in turn make it harder to learn.","

F-M181,"Have you ever been in a class and the lesson is so boring but the teacher doesnt know and you cant just go up to his face and tell his this is boring? With a new technology called Facial Action Coding System it enables computers to identify human emotions. Say youre in a boring class and you cant tell the teacher its boring, with the new technology the teacher will realize his lessons boring and hopefully attempt to change things up. This new technology could also save lives, say theres someone who very sad everyday but wheneverr anyone asks he asks all cheerful because he doesnt want anyone in his business, you could use the Facial Action Coding System to see if hes sad and help him out so he wont attempt anything awful in the future. With the facial Action coding system we can see everyones emotions from the past like wouldnt you like to see what a past president or any past heroes like Martin Luther King Junior's emotions were?

We're technologically advancing so much to where we are able to make items like the Facial Action Coding System. We have come so far, its honestly amazing what we can do with technology, not only is this new technology very helpful but its valuable and fun for anyone to use. This technology could be used as a serious thing or as a fun item.","

F-M182,"I am against using the value of technology to read students' emotional expressions. I'm not saying that this type of technology is bad though it isn't good either. I feel like this type of technology has no purpose what so ever.

In paragraph five it states that ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking at their face."" If I could do that why do I need a computer to tell me that they are happy, sad and whatever else. Just by looking at the Mona Lisa painting you can tell that he is somewhat happy but also doesn't seem like he cares about being painted. Why do we need to calculate emotions to know just exactly how a person is feeling?

F-M183,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The problem with this is that not all classrooms have computers. This new technology would only get used every time computers are used, so the FACS wouldn't get much use. That is why I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom.

The article states in paragraph one that FACS was developed to help humans and computers communicate. Then, in paragraph five, the article says that humans read each other's facial expressions all the time. I do not think that humans need computers to read each other's emotions if we already do it so well.

Another point to my argument is that the computer may not be able to read people's correct emotions. For example, there is no definite way of knowing Mona Lisa's emotions in his painting. Just because a computer says what his emotions are, doesn't mean that it is right. He may have been happy, he may have been faking; we simply have no way of knowing for sure.

The last point to my argument is using technology to read our emotions. Most teachers don't allow students to use electronics in the classroom. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". To me, a student's learning is more important than them being entertained. Now, being confused is an entirely different thing. If a student is confused they should ask the teacher to explain so that they do understand.

I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom. My biggest issue with this is the tech being faulty. If humans can read each other's emotions without much difficulty, I don't see why computers need to be able to read them as well. I don't see how that benefits anyone.","

F-M184,"During this paragraph the author would talk about how Venus is like earth well the closest to like being earth. For exaple they even called it its twin and talked about how Venus was once filled with ocean. ""Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth."" i think what the author is trying to say from this is that he supports the study of Venus because his or his point of view is that it very simialr to earth and it way of being.

Despite the fact that Venus is dangerous the author gives so much information for example it lets us know how thick its atmosphere. The percent of carbon dioxide it has. The temperature, although everything is dangerous to the human body and there bad weath, erputing volanoes and string earthquakes. Instead of hiding those facts he or he adds them on making it more intresting. All the information that is being given is making you want to study it more even if it dangerous. It shows that he supports the studdying of it and knows the worth and most that goes on.

Last but not least the author gives information abouth the studies that have been done, it informs us about NASA and how it has the idea of sending humans to more indepthy study Venus. Although he or he talked about the great sides of Venus they included the down falls and the things that happen from earthqukes to volcanoes, to oceans to the way a human could live there. They bring up many facts about both showing us that they know the dangerous things. Instead of not using the negatuve stuff he or he pulls it in and uses as a strong defense and brings good things in as well. In conclousion the author is very into the study even if it dangerous and makes it intresting to read.","

F-M185,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Some include less smog or pollution, stores would be places in walking distance, it saves time because there is less traffic, and it improves safety.

In Vauban, Germany, residents of this upscale comunnity are surburban pioneers, going where few soccer dads or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and father of two, as he walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In Bogota, Columbua, there is a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hikes, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his husband.

President Obama proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""    ","

F-M186,"I belive that the Facial Action Coding system reading is very accurate and can be used in the classoom might help. Theres many ways that if the teacher is aware he/he can might can help out that student. Theres a saying that states ""you cannot read a persons mind"" which is true but you can sense there emotions by the look on their face sometimes . The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson he can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/he is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the he can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can ""modify the lesson "" I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

In conclusion I believe that ther Facail dectection can be very helpful in the classroom setting. It can help teachers learn and create lesson for everybody to get a better understanding in what they are teaching. The analaysis can also help everybody to come more aware and understand facial expression.   ","

F-M187,"Car usage in different parts of the world are becoming non-existant. In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars in hope of having a more suburban lifestyle.

Car ownership however is not forbidden but there are only two places to park in large garages on the edge of the developement. A media trainer and father of two spoke about his details of this new rule, he stated he is much happier without a car. This will give children around a better enviroment to grow up in because everyone without cars will be outside playing, excercising, and riding bikes. In this new approach to they are making stores in walking distance from your home so you dont even need to use any type of transportation.

Paris also limits driving cars due to bad pollution. People were fined for driving on the roads with a 22-euro fine. These cold nights and warmer days were causing a warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was to blame since France has a tax policy that favors disel over gasoline. Delivery compaines complained about the stopage of veichles and lost revenue, but due to no one driving around the smog cleared the air.

in Bogota, Colombia they expirenced car-free day where everyone walked, hiked, road bikes, or took buses to work. Thsi was the third straight year where cars have been banned and buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars. The goal of this is to reduce smog in the air.

F-M188,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because we can know how that person is feeling at the time. Would you like to know if a person is feeling sad,happy,bored, or even angry? Of course,not only do we know how they feel but we can also take a step futher on helping them. If a person is depressed we can talk to someone close from them and explain what they are going through, or advice them for that person to take therapy.

The Facial Action Coding System is also a great start to poeple who are new to school or even to sports. If a person feels sad because they arent doing as good as their other teamates, The coach should use the software because it will let him/his know why that person isnt really trying in the sport. Another reason why im for it is because teachers really dont know when you are bored or confused. Especially if you are one of those shy prsons that dont like raising their hand. By using this software teachers can go up to you and explain you with what you are having trouble. If a student is bored with what the what teacher is teaching, he should probably try something new to get the students attention. This technology can also show us when someone has a fake smile for example if you think that you have a friend that really isnt your friend and you talk to his he might be giving you a fake smile because he probably doesnt like you.

The use of this software can determine if you are having problems in your house,the expressions that will show would be sadness and probably anger. In todays world you may be going through a lot but people may not know and they would treat you like garbage. This would then cause you depression and probably then commiting suicide. Having this technology ""Facial Action Coding System"" in hands can help you stop somone from danger.

having this technology can ressolve a lot of problems with putting yourself into it. Every perosn has a falling action and a resolution to their story. With just a facial expression it can change realtionships and friendships.""Making people smile"" is what we need with Facial Action Coding System!","

F-M189,"I believe that we should be using this technology in classrooms around the world. By using this tech it can help teachers modify their lessons to their students needs. This technology could help kids understand the subjects they are working on better because of how the teacher modified it. Teachers could learn how their students truly feel about the subject.

F-M190,"I believe that this computer would work wonders in a classroom. It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. In the famous, ""Mona Lisa"" painting, many people observe his smile and think that he is being forced to smile, and that he is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day!

This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health. If a child is slower than other children, this test could help decide whether or whether not these children need the extra help. If they do need help, this machine could even put them in the correct classes!","

F-M191,"Driverless cars are benifitial for some people. Not all agree on the dvelopments of driverless cars. Now of days, there is not much to expect with new technology. The invention of highly technological cars are high tech and can help with many world problems. Here is an explantion for people that are for the development of these cars.

The driverless cars are very impressive and a good idea if people want better safety on the road. If there was to be any drunk drivers on the road, which should not be driving to begin with, people would want to stay away from that person for the benefits of their own safety. With the driverless cars, the driver that is antoxicated and the other drivers on the road, would all be able to get home safely. The only problem with the driverless car would be driver having to park on their own, as said in the passage. The second example for why driverless cars are great would be a father driving with his infant. In case of any emergencies, the father could trust the smart car on steering for one second while he grabbed something for his child. Some people would call it laziness, but it could be very benefitial for a parent.

Understandably, there are reasons why people are against the development for these smart cars. For instance, the smart car mentioned in the passage that BMW made in 2013, that could drive on its own a certain speed. While also only being able to drive when the drivers hands are on the steering wheel. It sounds like a useless product if it is a driverless car. Secondly, why people are against it, is because it sounds like laziness. High tech cars became more popular with sensors in the 1980's as said in the passage. Before, people could walk to their destination and stay healthy. Now there are cars that don't need a driver. Those are some reasons why people are against the development of driverless cars.

In the end, driverless cars can solve many problems in todays world. From drunk driving to helping passagengers, driverless cars can help a lot. Although people who do not want smart cars to develop more, have reasonable reasons why they don't support it, many do support it. It can help a lot with road safety. Concluding that there are good reasons for the development for driverless vehicles.         ","

F-M192,"Driverless cars seem to be evolving from the looks of it, just reading this article makes me realize how close we are to the future and how close we are to driverless cars. I'm for it just because some people can't drive because their disability and if they just had to sit in the car and tell it where to go that'd be so helpful for them adn everyone eround them. If we're going to do it we might as well just do it already, no arguments for or against it. In the future, we have to make sure they are very safe and trustful. It could lead to a lot of angry people wanting their money back or it could lead to a lot of happy people wishing they had another one. Driverless cars can help a lot of people through things, I know drunk driving is very unsafe and if somebody who is intoxicated were to get in a car, it might aswell drive them itself, because chances are, if that person drives it him or his self they'd be endangering everyone around them. With the driverless cars it'd be way more safe on the roads throughout the night, and even the day. They're too many accidents just in traffic and if the driverless cars were smart enough to be able to sense how to work in traffic it'd be perfect! I can see it now, everyone is safe and cars are just moving along smoothly, not that they don't know but there is always that chance for an accident. Also, people with disabilities who may not be able to drive, they just physically can't, driverless cras would be an amazing idea for the. Now, I know this won't happen for another couple of years or so but it's more than likely that driverless cars would take over everyone's regular cars. That could be a good thing though. For one, like i've already stated it'd make sense for people with disabilities and intoxicated people. For two, it's probably the safest thing i've ever heard of when it comes to cars and driving. Some people still like to drive their own cars, oh well they can still do that, but people who cannot drive at all really deserve to be able to get out of the house and be able to get what they need. Especially, the drunk driving that happens pretty much every day here in America, we need a safer way to be on the streets and I think this is it. Too many people are being killed by drunk drivers and if they just didn't have to drive to get home, if only something could just take them home instead, therefore everyone would be safer, driverless cars could make America so much safer in that aspect. You have to really think about how much safer we would all be if driverless cars continue to evolve and progress. I personally, believe that we'd all be in a safer place, it's hard to even go out at night and not see a drunk driver. That's a very big and important reason why driverless cars would be great for us. Another reason, my dad works third shift hours at a hospital. He drives home in the morning very tired. Imagine if he falls asleep while driving, well it'd make his and I both more comfortable knowing that he wouldn't have to drive himself home when he is that tired. It'd just be so much more safe everywhere and all the time. It's make everyone not worry about whther or not they or their family and friends will be in an accident. It'd make everyone not worry as much about their car being damaged. It'd make everyone safer.","

F-M193,"I think that we can help people in america by going over sea to help people all over the world. I enjoyed playing table tennis with my friends on board after we had deliverd the animals. We also used to play softball and soccer when we were done. I still remeber the time I saw the Panama canal, the Acropolis in Greece, and the time I took a gondola ride in Venice. If you lived on a farm this is a great oportunity for you. I hope you can join and learn to love it.

I think that you would enjoy it even more if you loved animals. I loved feeding the horses and bulls. If you do join heres a tip, learn to love the animals and treat them very kind. Also dont spook the horses they are like big babies. The bulls shouldnt be as bad but be careful anyway. I loved spending time with the animals. It was a great experince.","

F-M194,"Why venus is worthy of studiying,Take this as an anology venus is that boy thats hard to get yet when you do get his he is so enjoyable.Venus is worthy of exploration because once upon a time venus was like earth.Here are three reasons why we should furthermore explore our brother planet venus.

Giving enough time venus can be inhabitable agian as it once was like our own earth some time ago venus looked like earth.I know this because in the text it says""Venus was probably covered in largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like those on earth.Today,Venus still has some features that are analogus to earth.(Challenge of exploring venus).""This shows how venus was at one point in time inhabitable and can somehow revert back to its old ways according to the text.

Another reason to keep studying venus is that it is completely possible to do so.Why you ask,Because there already is techonology being develpoed to initate study.The technology i speak of is a technology that can withstand the harsh conditions of venus.A great display of this is in the text in paragraph seven when they talk about it.Here it goes,""Nasa is working on other apporches to studying venus.For example,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condidtions"".This shows that nasa is on to something and that there is hope and purpose in studying venus.

The final reason is that this can be the way to human evolution due to us not knowing the future we prepare.What if one day earth is uninhabitable like venus,where would we go?What if we can go to venus and live on there.The thing about evolution and innovation is change and we can prepare for anything.This human evolution thing is backed by nasa themselves in paragraph eight.""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".This shows how we should think of things like this to move forward.

There it is my three reasons why we should furthermore explore venus.That shows how earths twin brother has purpose to be studied,remember venus was once like earth.    ","

F-M195,I don't think we should use the Facial Action Coding System to read childrens emotions expressions in school because what if the student didn't want the teacher knowing how he or he is feeling for personal reason? If we did that without permission it can lead to privaticy being broken and the students would probably feel uncomfortable. I also think we should use this because the passage says if a student looks bored or confused the Facial Coding can identifiy the problem and it can make the lesson eaiser for the student. The Facial Coding could also be useful because if a student is feeling depressed the machince can identify that and the student can get the help that he or he needs. We don't want students walking around school feeling that way because that can lead to decicions that a student wouldn't usually make if they were happy. Maybe we should get the Facial Coding System in our school systems.,"

F-M196,"The FACS( Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muslces of someones face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless peice of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to ""decode"" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions he was feeling that very day. He was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class wont change anything in the class room. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be effeciant to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because he would get differnt emotions from many different students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

The FACS( Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software but students in a class room would make the software useless          ","

F-M197,"I agree that driverless cars are coming. I agree because people are becoming lazy and try to find every short-cut they can. another reason is it makes driving more entertaining. And last a person can still controll the car if he or he wishes. Thats why I believe that driverless car are coming.

The first reason why i believe that driverless cars are coming is because people are getting lazy. People are gitting lazy by instead of walking they use hoverboards. Since people are getting lazy the next step is to have someone drive their car for them. People would buy this type of car so they would not have to put there feet on the pedal all day. Thats how I think people would buy this type of car.

Another reason is that this car would be more entertaining. It would be more entertaining beacause someone who is driving could use their phone because the car would drive it's self. The car could have a tv that someone can watch but when it their turn to drive it turns off. The driiver wouldnt have to be concerned about crashing when looking away because it could drive its self. Thats how this car would be entertaining.

Last the driver could still control the car if he or he wishes. The car notifys the diver when the road area requires human skill. This means the driver must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires. The GM has developed driver seats that vibrate when there is danger of backing into an object. Thats how who ever owns the car could still control it if he or he wishes.

I believe that driverless cars are coming. I do because of all of th information I said like that people are getting lazy. Also it would be more entertaining. And last a person could still control it if he or he whishes. That is why I believe driverless cars are coming       ","

F-M198,"The Electoral College consists of 528 electors. in order for the popular vote tobe valid, an Electoral Colege should continue as is. The Electoral College is a wide range of people who  know what it is thta they want. The Disrrict of Columbia is even considered to be a state just for the Electoral College purpose. The people of America choose their electors in which when they choose their Presidential candidate, they are choosing it's electors. The people of America are practically setting themselves up for whatever outcome comes into play.

Some people claim that people are not voting for the president, but are voting for the slate of electors. These people, however, are simply dramatic and have no sense as to what is actually going on in their country. People do no tvote for a president just because of his or his electors. Presidents are elected because they, as a candidate to be a president, have somehow persuaded the majority of the country to vote for them on their own behalf. A good president is elected because he or he is a good president, not because he or he has good candidates behind them. Yes, with a president comes his or his electors, but the electors are not the ones running for president, therefore they are not the ones persuading the people of America to vote for them, for it is the president that is doing the persuading, and the president that is receiving the votes.

The Electoral College has worked for many many years in the past and if held with respect will continue to work an be a successful way and form of voting. The outcomes will be valid and the responses will be accurate with reasonableactions following it.

The disaster factor is a claim that goes against the Electoral College, however it is not worthy of being a factor. A tie in the Electoral College is not likely, and if it were to happen, it could easily be resolved.    ","

And that its not really a face but really its sort of like an illusion ,because of the shadowing at the eyes, nose, and mouth. sure there are huge posiblities that this face can be an artifact ,but we have no proof.

In 1998 when scientist sent a probe back to mars, they had no evidence of

""The Face"" being an ancient artifact.

F-M201,"The Facial Action Coding System could be useful for panting and people as well. If you look at at painting at someone you really cant tell if they are happy or sad. If you use the Facial Action Coding System it could tell you how they are feeling in the painting and if they are happy or not. You can easliy tell if a person right infront of you is not happy but sometimes you cant. You can use the Facial System on them and it can tell you how they are feeling. Computers can also help out a lot on what you dont understand.

For instance in the Mona Lisa painting you cant tell his emotion in his picture. If you use technology it can help you out and tell you if he is happy or sad. It gives you a percentage like shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It can give you an estimation on how he is feeling in the picture. The computer has an 3-D computer model so it has all of the face major muscles so it can tell your emotion on your face. It can show your surprised if your eyebrows are raised up or if your angry yuour lips would be tightened to show anger. You can also write down different emotions that you do in the mirror and see if someone can reconize what emotion you have. It can tell if you force a smile and if it wasn't a real one. Technology is creating better ways to communicate with humans and developing different things for humans to interact with.

I believe that it would be very different and amazing if they use this on people ands paintings0. It could tell poeple a lot of things they are wondering about people in the world or even paintings that they see. It shows us that technology has plenty of ways to interact with us and give us new things to experince and learn about.","

F-M204,"My essay on the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is against the development of driverless cars because they are not safe.

Car development has come along greatly, but driverless cars are not the way to go. If someone's driverless car breaks down it will be extremely expensive to replace the parts necessary for function. Driverless cars also would take jobs away from working citizens such as; Cab drivers, Pizza delivery specialists, Postal workers, and Truck drivers. IN THE ARTICLE, it says ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."", but if the vehicle's system malfunctions the commands necessary to announce to the driver to manually operate wouldn't function properly.

Driverless cars can be very dangerous. When one is using a driverless car, he/he is putting his/his and their passenger's lives in hazardous conditions. No one should take that risk. ","

F-M205,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" article infroms the readers about Venus's harsh conditions and mankinds's curiosity to explore this unknown.

This curiosity has challenged The National Aeronaautics and Space Administration (NASA) to strive for a better understanding of Venus.

The author of this article supports this statement well enough, but could have supported his work better.

Throughout the article, the author describes the dangers of Venus explaining why exploration is diffiicult.

In paragraph 3, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" proving that Venus can not support human life or any of human technology.

The author describes the danger well, however, he/he does not address why Venus is a worth pursuit for discovery.

The author repeatedly uses the unknown aspect of Venus's physical attributes and humans' natural curiosity as the two main motives for exploration on this planet.

Paragraph 8 shows this by opening with, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author continuously uses those two factors as to why humans are so keen on pursuing this inhospitable planet.

There is a lack of evidence explaining why Venus is worthy of exploration but informed why we should be exploring Venus but the author describes the dangers of Venus very well.

To strengthen the author's suggestion, studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents, he/he should have included details on what the planet can offer humans or given more reasons as to why humans are so motivated to explore our brother planet.

The author only supports the dangers of Venus presents well in his/his suggestion but doesn't support why Venus is a worthy pursuit in exploration well.","

F-M206,"This new technology to allow us to read students emotional expressions is brilliant. Reasons being is it allows students to show their true emotion regardless if they act happy, or sad. This will more likely have less kids hide their emotion and can truly be worked on. It can be the difference between life or death. To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa. Using this advance system most people will say he is just happy and smiling, 'but he's actually 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry'. Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted.

F-M207,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Lisa smile never smiles he was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful adn 2 percent angry. Well to to me he was most likely angry if he never smiled when using technology you need to make it have a tester that will know everything before making it I feel like they should make a robot but before putting it out have a tester. I see the author asked can we caculate emotions like math well when doing math you have to learn anf figure out well to find out how someone is feeling you have do all of that to get the answer.

The author also asked how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movmetns well by making a robot that is like a human but very 100 percent truth- 3-D.The author says the facial expressions of reach emotion are universal, well you wouldnt know that unless you make a robot and find out if it would work there shoukd be a tester before puting it our.

I see the author has said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday but we human all are not the same it says we can probably tell how a friend is doing by how they face look well I walk around with a serious face people think im mad but im not see when you talk about doing all of this wanting to making things make sure you know what you talking about and that everything is working perfect.

If the technology gets made hopefully Lisa smile is 100 pecent happy. Teachers would need this just in case a student is mad and the teacher gets yelled at they would know like dang ok he or he is mad. So I think the technology should get made but before putting it out make sure it is working and that it tells the truth on how people is feeling and their emotions.","

F-M208,"I think that the use of the technolohy should not be used because then parent would be complaining how it is not fair for a teacher or students to know his sons/sons expression. Also I personally think that we shouldn't allow them because then teachers would always be focused on the kids that aren't as happy and are confused on the work or lesson they are learning. I also think that it would also be a good idea for the whole school because if a student is to shy to speak up and they dont know how to do something then the teacher can talk to him/his after class. I think that using this technology will be to much too and the school will have to use millions of dollars just to buy some for a whole class.

F-M209,"Luke said he grew up on an farm with his uncle so he wanted to help the animals. After World War 2 Luke wanted to help the countries recover by bringing food supplies and animals. Luke loved animals because when he was younger he had lived on a farm. So when he heard UNRRA is hirring Seagoing Cowboys to take care of Horses,Bulls,and Mules he and his friend Don signed up. This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""he says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or boy. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people. Then again you should always help people. Luke went would you?                 ","

F-M210,"""Dad im going to go outside to get some fresh air"" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean.

Its polluted.

But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a father of two . He walks verdant streets & love listening to his surrounding.

But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on.

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.     ","

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.     ]""

F-M212,"Throughout the years, in fact between the years 2002-2014, numerous newspapers and reporters have reported that having the lack of cars can actually benefit the earth and its population. Also, they say, there are advantages to them. but what exactly are these advantages that could prosper so many car loving fans? Well, there are actually 2 advantages of people would love to have:1, People are much happier and 2, the stress that afflicts many today are gone and also parks are blooming throughout one city because of the lack of the automobiles. So let's consider these wonderful advantages of not having any car.

His Name is Heidrun Walter and he lives in an area of Germany called Vauban. Vauban is a city where 'street parking,driveways and home garages are generally forbidden.' If to enjoy this kind of happiness in a world full of grim people, who wouldn't want to take up not driving a car?

Second, The stress that people have today are gone and at one city parks are blooming. According to the news reporter Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle times, he writes these words spoken by one businessman in Bogota, Colombia: ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress."" Mr. Selsky also writes this about the parks blooming throughout the city of Bogota:""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city."" The Advantages of not driving a car are pretty great.

F-M213,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is a waste of time. I think it's a waste of time because studies show that you can be able to tell when someone is down. Not by the face but by their actions. You will start to see a change in them, they wont act the same even if they try so hard to,ect. The Facial Action Coding System is a waste of money, time, and space.

Why do all this just to see if someone is hiding their emotions, when you can just observe them. A true friend, father, father ect; will know if something is wrong with their loved ones. In the article the very first sentence says "" he's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Why does it matter how fearful,disgusted,or angry he is if it clearly states he happy 83 percent. We are not computers, robots or none of that we are human beings and we all have different emotions running at the same time. Thats what makes us, us!

In the article it also states "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" My point here is that you dont observe a persons feelings by looking at their face. You observe the way they act and compare it to how they usually act when mad, sad, or happy, ect. People sometimes hide their emotions by putting on a fake smile, hiding their true emotions thats why you observe actions.

I just feel as if its easy to tell the difference between different emotions. It's common sense to me, but it may not be to you. When you really think about it, they make it seem like its really complicated. But if you would just pay close attention to your loved ones, and stop thinking that everyone has to always be happy. Then you will see that its easy to tell the difference of each emotion we humans have.

This is why i think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Hopefully you will understand where i'm coming from. The Facial Action Coding System is unnessacary, and a waste of time. It's easy to tell when someone is acting strange or different. All you have to do is observe.   ","

F-M215,"The Mona Lisa is a very iconic painting by Leonardo Da Vinci; however, no one pays attention to how his smile was constructed. According to the new computer software, Facial Action Coding System or FACS, he's 83 percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. This software is very useful and can help push technology ahead.

The process begins with a computer constructing a 3-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles must move like a human face. These movements are called action units. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and implied them to facial muscles. The software can even track mixed emotions. For example, the Mona Lisa as he has four different emotions in his picture.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to people's faces., while it shows just how much a computer can do. Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". He continues to go on about how it could modify a lesson like a human instructor. This can be very useful for children and teenagers who are homeschooled and take online courses. The same technology can make computer-animated faced more expressive for video games or surgery.

This FACS machine isnt very necessary for daily life, but can help in the classroom. It is very cool and interesting, and can help teachers know when students are struggling. This software is going to help humans in the future and will only become more advanced. Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". He is correct with that statement.

In conclusion, Dr. Huang and his colleague did a terrific job in creating such an advanced piece of technology. This will help teachers and schools in the future. The only problem is the cost of the item, because it will most likely be pretty expensive. Making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.","

F-M216,"Does the Electoral College Work?

Mr. Senator,

I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. Elector  groups are picked by the runner; the groups help raise votes for the runners to get more word out on what the runner has to offer for our country. Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and men, who are wanting to represent our country. Furthermore, the state elector running for president, is assisted by our votes, because when you vote for your candidates, you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" wizard list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.       ","

Just think about it; how often do you hear birds chirpping or kids playing at parks or even leaves rustling? if you were honest you would say almost never because its true all of the motorized vehicles that we have in this world drown all of the best sounds out. We simply don't hear them anymore; no instead we hear a train running by at tweleve in the morning or the screech of tires at six in the morning on the way to school or even worse we hear tons and tons of car horns going off all at once just because someone isn't moving at a red light. Seriously do we even know how horrible all of that is and guess what its all because the human population wants to be able to get places faster.

Most people are noticing this now but in the past no on noticed that our own way of trassportation was and is polluting the world. In Europe 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emmisions are caused by passenger cars. Also ""...up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(5) are greenhouse polluted because of the cars. The human race can stop this ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway""(6). See thats the thing we can change this and we can survive with out cars. There is no disadvantage of limiting car use because we can live without them. Infact there are only advantages; we can stop polluting the earth, we can have a safer world, and we can finally hear father nature and concentrate on something better in our lives. The thing is that we dont even have to go without cars because we have created electrical cars that are rechargable; yes they are very expensive but if we just used those then they would be alot cheaper. By having a car we are polluting the earth and by not having one we aren't; not polluting the earth is a advantage of limiting car usage.

The fact is that the advantages of limiting car usage out weigh the disadvantages of limiting car usage which is why having a car can help or hinder us; just depends on you look at it.    ","

F-M219,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe he was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what he really felt in the painting. All we know is what we see today and thats his smiling.

So in conlcusion I do agree and am for the Facial Coding Symstem all the way. It makes the paintings and pictures look nice, and have more emotion. So im all for it.","

F-M220,"The old question has finally been answered, ""Was Mona Lisa happy or was he just trying to trick his audience to think that he was."" Now, thanks to technology, we are able to figure out how he actually felt. With hard work and coding computers will be able to tell how people are genuinely feeling. This technology will help in schools, working environments and more, people will be able to tell if someone is feeling upset, depressed, happy, bored or content.

In relation to Mona Lisa, the article explains that he is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that the computer is advanced enough to identify emotions of a man from many centries ago. Due to the study of human anatomy the computer is able classify emotions like ""happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" With normal identification skills if there was a mix of them people could tell exactly how others felt. For instance if someone got 68% sadness, 22% angry and 10% fear, then people could tell that the person needed help, or was not fine like they said they were. If computers with this technology were in schools teachers would be able to tell if there student were okay. Most students say there okay but with this technology we would be able to perceive if people need help or theorpy. It could change the world by helping prevent less suidcides and self harm or peer pressure and bad decisions. Although it seems this technology could only be in sci-fi movies, the article explains that ""It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" Even so, with human persection we can not read or figure out everything from people by what they say and how they look but with the extra help from technology we can get even closer. Nick D'Alto confirms that ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Yes people have study this for a long time but the computer is just as capable without as much time. The computer reads peoples faces by creating a model and comparing it to the same persons face with no emotion and uses knowledge of the face muscles to determine one's emotions.

However, this technology could also do simple things within a class room like tell if a student is confused or bored or tired. In addition to this information from students schools can find what makes students want to get their education and can get them to enjoy and understand it at the same time. Nick D'Alto claims that ""Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Accordingly, with teachers and technology working together it could improve schools for students and teachers.

With this technology it could help overall morality and acedimics within classes. It could also help human communication, and get people and computers to work together more than before.     ","

F-M221,"Dear state senator,

I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when ever the person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs the other person who is not well known. Also if they do go to election school they could learn how to run for pesident and learn how to write speeches, and also teach them that some of the 50 states in the united states have to have his/his vote.

The out come of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then the outcome for next year will maybe bet higher or lower. When ever a US citizen votes they are also voting for the electors canidates. and when you do vote that person who is running for president that helps his/his's group get elected. Every president has to have a Vice president.    ","

F-M222,"The advantages of limiting car use are you become less stressed, you have cleaner air, and decreases the amount of traffic jams.

He is happier because he does not have a car. in the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" it also says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution...""

Secondly, limiting car use helps the air be cleaner. For instance, in the passage ""paris bans dring due to smog"" by Robert Duffer it says,""after days of near-recod pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars pollute our air so putting bans on cars will freshen our air.

Thirdly, limitation on the use of cars will decrease the amount of traffic jams. for example, in the article ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it states that, ""...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trffic jams."" with out so many cars being on the road other forms of transportation jush as buses or trams have room them to drive and be on time.

F-M223,"We have all seen the look on Leonardo da Vinci's very own Mona Lisa's face. Some might see a blank face. Some may see happiness, anger or even fear. A machine by the name of Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) can tell you exactly how he feels. This new technology can even be valuable in the classroom.

This recently created software scans facial movements. It weighs the different units of expression. Although Mona Lisa is just a painting that doesn't move, he is compared to a neutral face. According to Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, researchers of FACS, ""He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

It may seem unlikely that Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, only uses ""six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness"", but when the computer constructs a 3-D model, it uses all 44 major muscles in the face.

Imagine making a certain facial expression and your computer screen magically changes its settings. In the future Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could cause a dramatic postive change in test scores. Also not all students can gather information the same way. Students will want to know more if the information is grabbing their attention.

Allowing computers to scan information from facial expressions in the classroom setting can and will drive students to want to learn because of the personal format and reliablity.","

F-M224,"In my opinion I think it will be a good idea for the teachers to know if a student is in a good mood or not. When a teacher calls on a student and dont not want to go the teacher might think it is because that child is being rude, and all that the child want is to be left alone.

With the scaning programs, that could scan your face and can tell if you are in a good mood or not, teachers and student could have a good bond. If the teacher scans a kid face in morning when they all enter class he could know who to call on ,or maybe even after class he could even have a talk with the child. If someone can tell how a person feel if it's fear , anger ,digust, happiness,and surprise.

Those are some examples of ways it will be useful to have the ""Facial Action Coding System"". That type of technolgy would be very valuable in the classroom,and maybe even outside of school.","

Helping other people is awesome because then they look up to you. Caring for other animals is kind as well because then they will start to trust you and other animals will do the same.

Again last but not least you get to have fun! Who in the world does not like to have fun?

On board you get to do games like table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, baseball, and volleyball.

Luke claim is it is an apportunity of a lifetime and it's an adventure, you get to freetime and do cool things, and it will open the world to you. Before Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy he worked two part-time jobs he worked in a grocery store and a bank. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe in a cattle boat. Luke thought this was a chance of a lifetime and he couldn't pass it up so he went. When Luke was on his way to China Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. Now thats an adeventure and it shows how he had free time to do that. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger as he says. He says it opened the world for him. It allowed him to get a bigger picture of the world, and see what it was like. He says he is grateful for the apportunity and if you get an apportunity like that you should be glad to.

In conculsion this sounds like a lot of fun to me . All thought it is hard work and you have to be dedicated to it. In the long run though it would be worth it, because you get to help so many people. If you like going on adventures, helping other people, and having fun. Then a Seagoing Cowboy/Boy is the right job for you. What do you like most of being a Seagoing Cowboy/Boy?","

F-M226,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is suggesting that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, and I think that he does a very good job backing himself up. In this article he gives the things that are wrong with going to Venus but he also gives the things that are good and reasons why you should make a trip to Venus. The author of the story stays with the way he feels throughout the whole article making a strong and valid point. With the author not just telling you all the good things about going up to Venus is making his statement even more valuable. Becuase he is telling you upfront that their are some altercations and disadvantages of going but their are many ways that you can compromize and make it more safe for you to travel and be by Venus.

In the article the author states ""Astonomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" ""...Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" ""...mincludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These four quotes from the story are evidence that the auother put saying that Venus has features that are like Earth. Some other quotes from the story that are crutial in helping the auother prove that Venus is a good planet to explore despite the dangers is ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" These two quotes are telling us that if you were to go to Venus you wouldnt have to step foot on the panet you could stay in a vehicle and take pictures. And the radiation, higher altitude, and air pressure would be no different than in a plane above a storm because in the article it states ""Just as our jet airplanes travel higher altitude to fly over storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions..."" and the author also states in the article ""...air pressure would be close to that of sea level."" ""...radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

All these quotes show that there has been varios of ways to make it safe for humans to travel to Venus. And in the text it says ""...some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions"" this quotes is saying that not only do you not have to get out of the vehicle that goes up to Venus to see it and take pictures, that you can have an object that can pick things up so you can take it back down to Earth to examine it. The author states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This is saying that humans want to explore Venus, and that getting to go up there is going to answer many of the questions that they might have and it also answers all the curiosity that they have about the planet. The author has a very valid point at the end that makes you think it says ""... not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" He is saying that you should be scared and worried about all the things that could go wrong but think about the things that you will see and be able to encounter while on your trip to Venus. And the dangers of the trip are always a think you need to work out but through out the article they give ways you can fix them and make it safe for you to travel all the way up to Venus. ","

F-M227,"The technolology to scan your face and tell your emotions is kind of creepy. Having a machine in class to tell teachers how the students are feelling is just a little weird to me but it also could be very usefull. In the text it states that the software in the computer could see if you are confused and will change the lesson so the student will better understand.

The main reason why this is creepy to me is it reminds me of the Movie Tremator. In the movie Arnald Swartsnager comes back to the past to protect the future leader of the human rebelian aginst the superior robots they have built. Well to make a long story short the robot that Arnald Swartsnager plays can scan Robert Oconner's face and asked him why is your face leaking. Yes I know this technology is far more advanced than the movie ,but that is how I can relate.

I can also relate to how the computer could tell if you are confused and change the lesson so you can learn the way you do. In the text it states the computer can tell if you have a fake or forced smile or a guinine smile by the rincles under your eyes. The text also said you can probly tell what mood your friend is by the look on their face,but the person could be hiding their true emotions from you so the computer can tell if you are mad at that person at that time and place.

In the story the author includes how most video games and surgery cames have non verbal comunications,and how your home computer could never process this information like how your feeling that day.

I personaly would like to have this technology in our classrooms,and our homes. This would help out alot of men. For an example its your one year weading anaversery and you ask your lovley husband what he wants to eat. A simple question,but you rember that he can never tell you where he wants to eat. Or the example your kids come home acting odd you ask what is wrong but you dont get a responce. So you go in to there school computer and watch what mood he or he is in.

So I have told you my thoughts on the subject time to recap. I first thought it was odd and kinda scarry due to it reminding me of a movie and the robots. Then we relised that this technology can be great for the students who dont fo very well in school becaouse they do not get the lesson.","

F-M230,"Vauban, Germany, the motorless city. Vauban is an upscale community, yet they have one difference than any other, they have given up cars. When you visit this motorless city, you don't see driveways, garages or any other home accessory that invloves parking, or storing your car. When you think of a city like this, you think that there is no way a town can survive without automobile transportation, well, you thought wrong. Unlike most towns, Vauban has located all the necessary stores and shops on a main street, where it is easily found and just a walk away.

Vauban is also a happier place, as suggested by Heidrun Walter, father of two and media trainer. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" When he walks the street he sees young children playing and chatting and people riding their bicycles, but best of all, he doesn't hear that awful noise of a running motor.

Automobiles are a detriment to the ecosystem. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gass emissions from tailpipes..."" Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. And, up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Back to Vauban, the home of 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This town may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban lifestyle. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. This group promotes new communities that are less dependent on cars.

In the United States, ""car-reduced"" communities are being promotedby thr Enviornmental Protection Agency, and legislators are beginning to act, if cautiously. ""Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new 6-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year,"" Mr. Goldberg has said.    ","

F-M231,"Venus is a very powerful and beautifully dangerous planet, why wouldn't we want to explore his unknown? The author of ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes this question is a worthy one and believes it is worth the dangers.

The author supports his idea well and allows for the readers to understand how important it is. Venus is a worthy pursuit for the author and has given many details on how it can be achieved.

The author states that the surface of Venus is very close to what earth is now and was once the same as earth. Stated in paragraph 4,""

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Scientists at NASA are working to get close and personal with Venus and allowing the risks to be conquered. Paragraph 7 illustrates,""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The other project that will allow scientists to still have working things in the conditions of Venus is a mechanical computer. These computers need no electronics and use gears and levers to work. They are sturdier and more durable. As said in Paragraph 7,""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions.""

The author firmly believes that the temperatures of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth does not inhibit him from wanting to pursue it further.

The author illustrates how the dangers and problems scientists are facing do not out weigh the curiousity of the minds of the human race. He supports the idea with powerful and strong details. With all of our curiousity focused on our strange and beautiful neighbor Venus, why would we ever stop trying to learn more about his? The beautiful mystery that is Venus is a wonder to all that wish to know. He isn't called the ""Evening Star"" for nothing, he shines and is pursued.","

F-M232,"Cars can have a really bad effect on society. It can cause stress, car accidents, and money issues. Limiting cars has alot of advantages, it's a stress reliever, no car accients or worrying about how your gonna have to pay your car insurance.

In Vauban, Germany residents are living without cars. One men Heidrun Walter, a father of two, explains how he is much happier without his car.  57 percent of people have moved to the community when they heard about the community. It is said to be called smart planning. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S.. You don't have to worry about how your going to make it to your favorite store or market without a car because stores are places a walk away, on main street. The Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting car educed communities and legislators are starting to act.

Paris enforced a limiting driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days. France enacted a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

Bogota, Colombia created a program called the car-free day. Powerful people from other countries camre to Bogota to see the mindblowing event. Parks and sports center have been createdbecause of this event.

In the U.S. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting feweer licenses as each year goes by. Rates of car ownership per household and per person strted to come down two to three years befpre the downturn. Teens are starting to organize their life around when they can walk, take public transportation or car-pool.

If we were to limit car usuage will the enviroment get better or stay the same? Nobody is saying to get rid of all cars, people are just saying that we can limit the amount of cars we use or the amount of time we  spend driving them. Limiting car usuage is a very big step in a revolutionary change and also has alot of advantages to them.                                    ","

F-M233,"The author of ""The challenge of exploring space"" does a excellent job supporting the arugument that Venus should be further explored. They did this by using research done by NASA, scientific projects, and even presenting challenge to the reader or audience.

In pararaph 5 the author intoroduces an idea that NASA has made special products to explore the face of Venus. The author says "" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiing venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a high altitude to fly over many storms, a vehice hovering over venus woud avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This evidence helps convey the idea that the face of venus shoud further be explored because space experts have been working on it.

Similarly, in paragaph 7 the author intorduces a new idea that NASA has also been working on. Electronics that can survive the harsh enviornment of Venus. The author states ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This is another piece of evidence the author used well to support their agument that Venus shoud be further explored because we have the ability.

Lastly the author proves his argument rigt because he/he presents a challange at the end of the article that makes you want to take action. The author says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginaton and innvoation."" This is the last sentence of the article and the writer did a very nice job using it as a challenge to face and a call-to-action. This sentence will make reasearchers accept the challenge, which will prover his argument correct.

Overall, the author did an excellent job of presenting the argument and being able to support it with different types of evidence and even a challenge. The method he/he used was very effetive and proved a point very well.      ","

F-M234,"The idea of a driverless car has been an idea only meant for science fiction films. The concept of the whole idea seemed as though people would not see in their life time. Until now, engineers and scientists are closing in on the idea that self driving cars are a thing of today. Top car manufacturers are now developing ideas and ways to bring us closer of this once fascinating dream, into a reality. To wake up some day and simply send a text or call a local business to send a driverless car to give them a ride to where ever they need to go. Also, the amount of time saved for people not having to car for their cars and take them to body shops and pay high prices for problems in the engine.

But before the idea can pick up even more on its popularity; some people may ask what would its use be?

There many young adults and teenagers who still have not received their drivers liscense and have to wait on a parent or guardian to come pick them up from school, activity, or sporting event. With the self driving car, those people may some day just call or text a business operating the cars to come and pick them up and drive them home. This method would relieve the stress of the parents having to drive there and wait on their loved ones. This method may also be used to replace the tradtional taxi driving system. The traditional taxi system was said to be unsafe under certain situations. for example the taxi driver can manipulate the customer if the customer is unaware of the streets and driver can then take the longest route to charge a substainally high price for a drive that was not suppose to take as long. With the driverless car, the car will not manipulate the customer and reach its destination at an efficient time and price. Along with the amount of fuel saved from the driverless car, our economy may no longer rely on fossil fuel as a sufficient source of energy for our cars.

Another reason why the driverless car idea might be successful is the lives it could save for the drivers who are not paying attention. some cars may not be driverless but the ones who can break before the driver can react is amazing. A popular car with the system that the car can break before you can react is Subaru. Subaru has always been popular with its safety features, but now, with the newest models, the car is now capable of stopping itself before an accident can occur. How this works is that this car isn't necessarily driverless, it is still a driver needed car. But what makes this car stand out in safety is its sensors in the front and the back of the car. it is used to detect any situations or actions of other drivers that can start an accident. In one scenerio, a mentleman is backing up his car from his driveway and is distracted by his child in the back, not realizing he was still backing up the car's sensors detected an oncoming vehicle and immediatly stopping the car. The car saved the mentleman and his child from injury and the mentleman will notdeal with insurance for damages and costs of repairs. This is just one of the dozens of scenarios that can happen when a driver is not paying attention and could lead to serious accidents. With smart technology we can save the lives of millions of drivers whose accidents could have been prevented.

in conclusion, the idea of driverless cars is still a thing to be worked on and in need of improvement. But we are not far from seeing cars without drivers driving safer and more efficiently than human drivers. Not to mention the growth the economy will have from people switching from buses and uncomfortable rides with strangers. driverless car will not harm other drivers or harm how we see cars, instead we will see them as a safe, efficient, and well protected vehicle for transportation. Even if we do not succeed in having driverless car, we still have had many advancements from keeping drivers safe and preventing accidents that could be saved. ","

F-M235,"The advantages of limiting car usage is outstanding not only is it good for the earth but it changes peoples lives, it makes the people happy and they tend to enjoy life more. In fact in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" it states ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The article also says that Heidrun Walter, a father of two, was always tense when he was behind the wheel and so he gladly gave up his vehicle and now lives a very happy life in Vauban.

In Paris they banned driving due to the increase of smog, they planned which days the people could drive on. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it states ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" At first many people refused and were fined 22-euro ($31) but the people who didn't helped lighten up the smog.

In Bogota, Colombia, the people have a car free day where they walk or ride their bikes to the places they need to go but there are still buses and cabes that the people can take. If the people were to take their own car they would be fined $25.  In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it states ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" The article also says that millions of colomibians have biked, hiked, skated, and rode on buses to work.

In America the people are driving less, buying fewer cars and getting fewer license. The article ""The end of the csr culture"" states ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.""

It says that we humans use the same caluculations everyday when we can tell the emotions and feelings of our peers. This technology would be like a emotion calculator for pictures and paintings.

F-M237,"If we think about it, this software is actually a big help for the schools and such. If we see our friend is in a bad mood then we can talk to them or find out why. I think this system can actually really help us but not only us but our teachers as well. The system digs deep into our muscles and will understand our whole face. It will indicate actions, emotions and feelings so that could help our friends if they are wondering why we are in a happy mood or a bad mood.

Our friends are really helpful at times so if our friend is feeling down or is happy about something we should have the right to know. According to Dr. Huang the software can tell us many things about a persons mood or what they are really feeling like. Knowing if a person is down or happy we can talk to them and ask what is going on, why are you sad or why are you so happy. By the computer telling us how a person is feeling will be so valubale because it shows us how big our technology is getting and by us knowing that we know there is going to something bigger than that later on in the future so now all we would do is wait for something bigger.

This software would be very helpful fot our own teachers because they could take us to the computer get our face to the computer and indicate if we aare bored or not. If he does this while he is teaching lesson and finds out we are confused then he can change his ways in teaching that lesson so we can actually understand it and if the teacher knows we are in a happy mood then he knows we understand the material or atleast thats why we are happy.

The Facial Acting Coding System would be a really good thing for us so we ned to get it attachted to our school software. All together it would help our friends and teachers. Espically the teachers because they would know what to do to teach us better so would understand the material that they want us to learn and the system would be a genuine thing. Not only would this help with teaching and understanding but for our friends that have depression, we would know when there emotions are hurting or when they are in a hurting place and we could help them by this software being a thing. People with depression never show it and we understand that but we could atleast do something about that and that is helping them and being there for them.","

F-M238,"The posibilty of a face reconizing computer would be very helpful for children or even adults. Its would be helpful in a ways of satifying our needs and why showing us thing that would make going on the internet better.

I think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says "" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"". And if the students is ""confused and bored"" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.

In my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what his/he is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.","

F-M239,"There are many ways of limiting car usage. Some advantages of limiting usage are people are much happier and safier, you dont have to hear the aggravating sounds of motors and tires screeching by, and air pollution is decreased majorly.

In the first passage, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and father of two children stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By this he means he doesn't have to worry about his or his families safety as much, being on the road is a lot more dangerous than walking. Driving you can never tell when there's going to be an accident, everything just happens so fast. There is nothing you can do to prevent car wrecks from happening. You may do everyting in your power to be a safe driver but there will always be other people on the road not paying attention and cause a crash that you can't prevent. Walking where you need to go is the safest way to get around. You don't have to worry about car crashes or worrying over your families safety.

Another example of the advantages of limting car usage in passage one is, not hearing the screeching sound of car motors or tires flying by. Instead of hearing the familiar sounds of cars passing by you hear the joyful sound of children wandering around or riding their bicycles. People find it more calming to hear the sound of a child enjoying themselves instead of hearing the roaring and deafing sound of vehicles going by. When people are at home trying to relax they do not want to hear loud noises through their neighborhood. That's suppose to be their winding down time to escape from everything. Without vehicles people would be a lot more calmer, and relaxed.

The last example came from the second passage. It states that there is a major decrease in air pollution in Paris as they enoforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. One day they ordered people with even-number license plates to leave their cars parked or suffer having to pay a fine. In the text it states that, ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" With this being done congestion was down sixty percent in the capitol of France. By them taking control they reduced the amount of air pollution in Paris.

By limiting the usage of vehicles we make people a lot happier and safeir, you don't hear the annoying sounds of cars screeching by, and last but not least air pollution is decreased in a huge amount.            ","

F-M240,"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are  acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.  acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars he said that when he had a car he was always tense and now that he doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. he doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave his with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.  it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/his house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.    ","

F-M241,"Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young bulls, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing bull was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,""he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. In 1945 world war 2 made places get ruined so he decied to go to Seagoing Cowboys. He help animals like horses,young bulls,and mules too. He had so much to do but he did it and yes it was hard but he did what he was suppossed to do. A Seagoing Bull boy was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world up to him. He is gratefull of the opportunity.           ","

F-M242,"The electoral college doesn't work for everyone its not fair. There are people who want a good president to run the conutry, not just some guy that the electors pick. Electorl College is not a good way to pick a president the people are not picking them isnt that want it suppost to be people pick the president not electors. In the text the author write that the electorl college doesnt let the people that have the most vote win because your picking a elector and the elector is picking the president even though he/he has the most vote its not fair. We the people should be the ones picking the president, we are the one who want him/his to run the coutry because we think he/he can do it.  The electoral college should be abolishied and people should pick the president.

There are state in our conurty that are smaller then other states. Those small states dont get a say in the voting for the president because the bigger states rule over because of the electorl college rule. The author says ""larger states like Flordia has 29 electorl vote and Wyoming only has 3 electorl votes."" So that means that the larger states get more attention form the president then the smaller states do. That's not fair the smaller states should be treated like the bigger states not left out. The electrol college (electors)is the one picking the president not the peoplein the small or large states. The electorl college should be removed and the people picking the president and the smaller states get a say in it too.      ","

FACS enables computers to identify human emotions in picutres, and aslo videos. In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" The author states that in the famous Mona Lisa picute by Copy Leonardo

Da Vinci the renasissance painting. The painting of Mona Lisa his facial expersion was "" He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""There is no way that technology can scan a painting from the 1600's and find the painting facial expression out.

In paragraph 4 the author says "" ""The facial expresions for each emotion universal observes Dr. Huang"" "" ."" even though indivisuals often vary degrees of expression "". Dr. Huang is saying that it is impossible to find out someones emotions in a photo of them. In paragrah 3 the author says "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face ; all 44 major mucels in the model must move like human muscels."" The author is saying that there is no possible way that a computer can scan a persons exspression in a photo because of the the camreas frame and the movement of the person in the photo.

In paragraph 7 the author says "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" The Mona Lisa painting was in the 1600's it is impossible to figure out what was his expression.

F-M244,"using facial expresions are a good way to tell someone u are mad or happy. but sometimes u cant tell the diffrence unless people smile all the time. for instince when i walk i have a mean face that dosent mean im mad i could be happy but its just how my face is. u shouldnt need technology to tell someone if your happy ot sad all they gotta do is look at your face and they should already know if your mad or sad.

if the person isnt sure they should ask and see wether if your mad or sad. mona lisa smiling is just showing that shes happy or that he was happy while taking the picture. to be honest i think u can smile and feel something other than happiness. like when someone is mad and they smile just to seem like there happy.

i really dont get how u can calculate emotions like its an emoiton not a math question u either ask if the person is mad or sad or u just guess off the facial expressions. thats how i see it in my eyes itll be much easier to just ask then to do reasurch.

i think the smile should be used to show happiness people can be happy for just a moment then change there face which i understand i do it all the time. mad face should show if your mad. sad face should show that your sad. it shouldnt have to involve technology to find out how the person feels. mona lisa is a wonderful painting but i think he was happy in the picture because he smiled.","

F-M245,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author introduced a new technology. It is called the Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to identify human emotions. Those emotions can be portrayed on a human or on a painting scuh as, The Mona Lisa. This new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable. It is valuable because it can figure out exactly what someone was feeling and it could help schools.

Now, figuring out exactly what someone was or is feeling may not be so important to you. It could be very important though. For example, in the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", paragraph 1, the author tells us exactly how Mona Lisa was feeling. He was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. For the moste part he was happy right? But what about the 17% of his feelings that were filled with disgust, fear, and anger. Whatwas causing those feelings. Think about it. If we can figure out exact emotions of people from the past, we could dig in and find out a lot more about our world's history. Those 17% of emotions could be nothing at all, but what if it was a major. What if it was something we didn't know about his.

This new technology could also help out schools. In aragraph 6, the author talks about how the Facial Action Coding System could potentially improve classrooms. That would result in smarter people in this world which is great. The technology could read your facial expressions to see if you are bored. If you are bored, then the technology could improve the classroom to be more interesting to you. If you are more interested in the subject at hand, then you will understand it better. If you understand it better, you will have better grades and have more knowledge. This will ultimately result in smarter people in the world.

So the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It can help us find exact emotions of a person. It could help us with with our schooling. We could find out so much more about our world and increase the IQs of others. This system could be so important for our world. ","

F-M246,"Some may say that they need cars to get around. Some people love thier car and could never dream of giving it away. Some also don't care about cars that much. Well in Germany and Paris cars are banned, yes I said banned. Some people may be shocked at this but others not so much. Some may ask how do they get around places? Some might ask so do they just walk everywhere from place to place? Some may ask do they actually like living without a car? Some might not even agree with the whole banning cars thing and may have lots of other questions. Well if you wanna know the answer to those questions well read on. Pay attention while you're reading and as I explain to you why these people think life is better without cars.

Having a car is important to dad's especially to the dad's that have about three or more kids. Dad's have dudies to do including taking sons to soccer ball games. Well a dad in Vauban, Germany got rid of his car. He actullay enjoy being car-free, and get this seventy percent of Vauban's families don't own a car. Also fifty-seven percent of people sold their car just to live there, obvisously more and more people are agreeing with this no car thing, and they would much rather take buses and taxies.

Now am not saying that everyone will agree about banning cars, read on to see how the people in Parris disobeyed the no car rule and what happened to them. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay 22-euro (31 USD). The same would apply the next day for the odd-numbered plates. According to an international news agency headquartered in London almost four-thousand drivers were fined. Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Some people may not know the real reason that people try to limit car use or even ban it in some countries. Its to take away stress and to lower air pollution. In Bogota, Colombia they had a care-free day and it turned into a big hit. On this car-free day millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. Leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. You know but not everyone was willing to parcisepte in this event and those people faced twenty-five dollar fines. This program was set to sprend to other countries and it did. For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event, and they were happy.

In conclusion limiting car usage or even banning cars is a good way takes stress and lower pollution.

Having to drive around alot can put a lot of pressure on a person and the pressure is lifted when they dont have to drive anymore. Air pollution is bad there are already a lot of things polluting the air why not make cars one of things thats not polluting the air. Also there will be less car traffic noone likes being stuck in traffic. I think that limiting car usage is a good thing. It will save us in the long run.            ","

F-M247,"The author does not support his/his idea to study Venus very well. The author presents mostly negative effects on humans researching Venus. He or he should have showed more facts for their side then for the negative side of visiting Venus for research. There are many dangers with sending humans to research Venus and the author states this.

The author states in paragraph 3 ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venum. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" The author goes on to talk about how NASA had the idea to send a hovering vehicle over to Venus to explore but if the clouds are corrosive how do we know how far they go. The temperature at Venus is also dangerous conditions for humans.

The author states that NASA had ideas to study using the vehile or simplified electronics. In paragraph 7 it states ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" If we send electronics over there to get pictures and calculations how would we put it on the surface and take it off of the surface. The author needs more details about this idea before stating it as a good idea. The author thinks that the hovering 30 or so miles above Venus is not a good idea because the scientist can't get samples to study Venus's atmosphere. The author states ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduch a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The author isn't to worried about the humans getting sent up there and thinks they should do it in dangerous conditions.

The author states facts on previous missions but these do not support his/his idea. Previous missions to Venus were unmanned. The author also states in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If spacecraft didn't survive it how would humans.

The author needs more facts supporting his/his idea instead of against their idea. This article should be more like a argumentable essay with stating facts from both sides. The author makes this article more of a persuasive for the opposite of what they want. They need to get more facts and ideas for not only their side but for both sides. I think that this article was more opinionated rather than using facts to support the articIe.I also think the author did well with stating facts opposing his/his side but did not give me enough information to support their idea.

F-M248,"Do you think the Facial Action Coding is 100 percent valuable and correct? In my personal opinion I say no. I have three reason that can explain why this technology is not valuable. I could be frowning and be happy ,but showing a sign of joy. Don't always trust technology; it sometimes can lead in the wrong way. Im amuse that people are relying on technology to lead them in a direction that could be wrong.

In the article it said "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelging simply by the look on his face."" That's very incorrect because many times I'll ask my friend how he is feeling when he looks grumpy. He would say im good with me not knowing that because me thinking his facial expression is saying something different. People ask me all the time whats wrong with me when; I turn out to be just chilling. Some people natural look might just be a mug. I learned that the hard way its so very true.

Trusting technology can give you false information. I remember this time I sprained my foot. I went to the doctor to get in x-ray and the x-ray information was showing that nothing was wrong with it for a period of time. Although, im glad the doctor knew what he was doing ;he then figure out that the inner of my foot was spained. The bone was slightly bent and I needed time to heal it and recover. It sounds like the Facial Action Coding System is like a x-ray machine.

I understand that the Facial Action Coding System is a use of technology. With that being known we can believe that the technology want always be right. You can get stuff off the internet thats not true information, but yet it's a source of technology. Many people just go to get there information off of wikipedia for a research project. You never know if the stuff is true because any one can edit it. So you can compare the Facial Action Coding Sysytem with gettig information off of the internet these are both sources of technology.

Is it a possibility that the Facial Coding System is valuable? Yes but I wouldn't put all of my trust into it. Just because im frowning don't assume that something is wrong with me. Or if someone just has a mug as a look don't think that their mad. It can come back that your wrong. Believeing that everything with technology is true is very false. It a good chance that the technology is off. The Facial Coding Sysytem like a x-ray scanning. Sometimes it can give true information sometimes it can't.        ","

It a good chance that the technology is off. The Facial Coding Sysytem like a x-ray scanning. Sometimes it can give true information sometimes it can't.        ]""

F-M249,"The author supports their idea very well. The story is very convincing to start off. The authornmakes sure to mention a lot of evidence to back up his/his statements. The author mentions a lot of facts with another fact to prove it is true. The author did good with trying to get their point across because of all the points they made to back up his statement.

The reason I think the author did good is because the author seemed to know what they were talking about.

The author mentions how Venus is most alike to Earth. Also that is just one of the many statements the author makes. The author had also used other statements to compare to why we could go to Venus. The author even gave their own idea on what think is possible. The author uses plenty of facts to help his idea and what he/he is trying to say. The author even says how NASA is working on approachesto study Venus and that helps make the essay even better. The author does not see his idea as a risk and more as a challenge. The author seeing it as a challenge shows he confidence in his idea. The author also uses how Venus has so many things alike with earth that it should be explored.

So all in all the author made a good essay and did well supporting his idea. The author was consistent with his/his idea.

The author made sure to use important facts to support their idea. The author was well rounded and did not seemed biased with their idea and was very convincing with what they said.","

F-M250,"I am all for Thomas Huang new invation. I think that the FACS is a grate invation we finaly have a way to see how people are feeling just by this computer. How this device works is that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then studys all 44 major muscles. Moving one or more mucsles is called an action unit. After that Dr. Huang relies on Dr. Pual Eckman, the creator of FACS to find out how the preson is feeling.

The FACS software can track facial movements even if your not smiling as broadly. Just when you think that is all it can do it can also identify mixed emotions each exspession is compared to a nertarl face showing on emotion. We humans can also do this, but we would have trouble describing each facial trait. Dr. Huang wants to do a test on Mona Lsa to see if he is really smiling or not. There going to use the software to see if it can tell use if he is or not.

as you can see this software is a grate tool i can see this devise helping use out a lot in the futer. If you are interested in doing this then go look at your self and then ask your partner if he or he knows what your feeling right now. I fell like we should have more people like Dr. Huang, and Dr Paul Eckman cuase the world is changing and we need to try to keep up and not fall be hind. Life is a intresting thing and what you do with it is all up to you. ","

F-M251,"Limiting car usage has a lot of advantages in everyday life. Cars are the one destroying the planet. When the cars' smoke gets to the atmosphere, the atmosphere gets destroyed by it. If we destroy the atmosphere then what or who is going to take care of our planet from the powerful sunlight. Also limiting cars may also save you a lot of money. Think about all the money we spend on gas for cars, we can do a lot better for the world with all that money.

Now I'm going to talk about some evidence in the article that makes limiting car usage better for life. In source 1 ""In German Suburb, Life Goes Without Cars"", Heidrum Walter, a citizen from Vauban said that he lives happier without cars because when he had a car he was always tense (paragraph 3). Now in sourse 2 the article says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer of air to trap car emissions(paragraph 15), and that is really bad. Also in source 2 again the last paragraph says that the smog cleared when they banned the usage of cars.

In source 3 paragraph 24 Carlos Arturo a businessman from Bogota, Colombia said when Bogota's streets were car-free that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. At last, source 4 says that now that there is less driving, safety in the cities have improved.

So I say that we must limit car usage because of all the things i mensioned in the previous paragraphs. The city will be safer, the planet will be safer and everything will be better.            ","

F-M252,"Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not suprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the ""easy"" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, trolly's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, trolly's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollusion and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a  new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rush-hour. This means less time spent with family andmore tijme bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoides all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and father of two says ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Everyday he walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something he was unable to appretiate with his windows rolled up as he drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our enviroment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.                            ","

F-M254,"Ever heard of using technology to read students' emotional expressions in a classroom? Of course not, because it is not necessary. What good would come out of scanning a student's face? The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" does not give many reasons on how this technology would benefit people. This technology is also a little confusing with giving information. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is unvaluable because it serves no real purpose, would cause confusing emotional problems, and we shouldn't have to rely on it.

By human nature, we can already tell or sense how someone around us is feeling. Why would we need the technology of reading someone's face when we can do that by looking at a person? Maybe not always, but for the most part we can tell when someone is feeling down or happy. In paragraph 5 of this article it states, ""...we humans perform this same impressive ""calculaion"" every day... you can probably tell how a friends is feeling simply by the look on his face."" This supports how this technology is not exactly needed.

""He's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Which is it? Is he happy or angry? Why is he disgusted and fearful when he's mainly happy? This technology would describe several different emotions that one is feeling. Because of this, it would be confusing to really understand someone. In paragraph 4 it states, ""Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This supports how people do show various emotions, so it would be confusing, whereas without the technology, people can question each other and converse.

Why rely on this technology instead of actually communicating?

We are people, and in a classroom, bonds can easily be made. Therefor, we can talk to each other in order to discuss emotions. Paragraph 6 states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" Even though having this technology where ""it could modify the lesson,"" would be helpful, it's not something we can't do ourselves by talking. Paragraph 6 also states, ""...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows the technology would be beneficial in a way, but it's not valuable nor necessary.

This technology to read the emotonal expressions of students in a classroom is not valuavble due to not having a good enough purpose for use, it's confusing; almost unreliable, and we can communicate without it. In a classroom, we should be able to express our emotions without the technology. We can verbally discuss topics and share. This technology would not be as valuable as a good teacher, tutor, or instructor. ","

F-M255,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The author makes the claim that the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the artical the author informes his or his reader that ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

""In the text the author starts off his senteces with ""Long ago,"" This simply proves ""no spacraft survived the landing for more than a hours,"" which is also stated in the text in paragraph 2. In paragraph 2 the author also states Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is making it clear it want be easy doing research on Venus.

In the text paragraph 3 states ""A thick atmosphere of alomost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clounds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times than what we experience on our own planet.""

The author is make his or his point how exploring Venus can be very challenging.

In the text the author states ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

The author is making it clear as posible of the danger that comes along with studying Venus's atmosphere. The author states in paragraph 5 ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA) has one particularly compelling ideal for sending humans to study Venus.

""[Essay Content: F-M255 / ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The author makes the claim that the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the artical the author informes his or his reader that ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

""In the text the author starts off his senteces with ""Long ago,"" This simply proves ""no spacraft survived the landing for more than a hours,"" which is also stated in the text in paragraph 2. In paragraph 2 the author also states Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is making it clear it want be easy doing research on Venus.

In the text paragraph 3 states ""A thick atmosphere of alomost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clounds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times than what we experience on our own planet.""

The author is make his or his point how exploring Venus can be very challenging.

In the text the author states ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

The author is making it clear as posible of the danger that comes along with studying Venus's atmosphere. The author states in paragraph 5 ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA) has one particularly compelling ideal for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the Hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" The author is backing up his or his claim by using a outsiders voice. In this case The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

In the text the author state in paragraph 7 "" NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.""Once again the author is using a outsiders voice to state his or his claim.

F-M257,"Today I will be talking about my opinon on driverless cars. I think that driverless cars are not really that safe because if cars have trouble with actual human driving them what makes people think to make cars without humans driving them. I also didnt think General Motors created a concept car that could run on special test tracks because, I asked my grandpa who is a retired mentleman from General Motors and he had no clue at the time.

There are a lot of people in this world that have many different opinions about cars that can go places without a human driving it. Cars can be smart at times like it says in the passage but, there not that smart to not have a person behind the wheel in my perspective. I think that would cause a lot more accidents and there's already enough of those every day.

I can say one thing though. If we could have a car without a person driving it that can be good for people that does not like strangers in cabs driving them around so maybe if there was cars without humans driving them that would be good and people could be a lot more comfortable. Also, that could prevent kidnapping as well. Because i've read articles about people getting kidnapped by a cab driver which could be the worst feeling ever.

For the most part, there are good and bad ways to not have a human driving a moving vehical. But not all good opions are safe either. Even though many others could have different responses and opions about how they think about driverless cars, these are jus mine.","

F-M258,"Being able to read the emotional expressions of students can be innovating. Many student can have problems, but with this technology it can be solved in minutes. The use of this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students because if the student is having problems the teacher can help them with their problems, the teacher is aware of what his students emotional expressions are, and other students can help other students according to what emotional expressions they show.

The use of this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because if the student is having problems with their emotions the teacher can help them out. According to the passage it states "" Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This means thats as the machine shows the emotinal expressions of the student the teacher can see what he or he is lacking in and maybe help with that.

The use of this technology is valuabke to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom because the teacher is aware of what the students emotional expressions are. Accoridng to the passage ""there is new computer software that cna recognize emotions."" This means that the teacher is going to be aware if what his students emotionak expressions are going to be.

The use of this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because other students can help other students according to what emotional expressions they show. According to the passage this machine can detect facial movement to see what the emotional expression is about the student. Therefore this means that other students can help other student if, lets say for example if a student is 90 percent disgusted, then other student can help his to feel better.

This technology could be innovating to many schools in the world. It can help detect if students could be depressed, or have trouble at home, it can help teachers to help their students out. All in all this tchnology is valuable because it can help a lot of kids from suicide or many more things because if the machine detects that they are depressed the teachers can help.

F-M259,"9When looking at the world from a birds eye view, it is possible to see the beauty in the world; Even so, in certain developed and developing areas, the people are choking. The choking is not just supported by the violated environment, but along with that, society is an advocate for the pain of the people. An intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars. With the progressing world also comes regress, and according to an article wrriten by the New york times in 2013, it was stated that in countries such as the United states of America, ""Americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each yeat goes by."" This eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the U.S.A. Although the car industry may suffer from this, it is essential to note that, the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public. In fact, in the long run, the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole. This can be seen in three major ways, with first, public benefits , second, cheaper and time-saving methods , and finally the unmatched environmental benefits .

As people continue to choke from the pain, it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem, and limiting car usage is the definately one of the best ways to reduce the harms. The public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress , more space , and increased saftey . Starting off with stress, Heidrun Walter, a father of two children stated that he was ""always tense"" when he had a car. he now lives in the German city of Vauban. Here most people have given up on cars, including Mrs. Walter. As a father of two he ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation. With Mrs. Walter, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". These people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit. Moving toward space, an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in 2009, states in this new approach, we will have make it so there is less space for parking. With less space for cars, there is more space for people. Not only that but with the increased limit, there is a decrease in traffic. Traffic can be extremely long, and in this case it will help to increase public space. Although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety, in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat. Therefore, with their limit, there can be an increase in safety for the people. Moving back to Mrs. Walter, he as a father of two did want the best for his children, and above all comes their saftey. Meaning that his choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces.

Although people do want to benefit as individuals, it really comes down to the cost at the end point. But limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person. In fact, by limiting cars, alternate transportation is promoted. Countries such as Colombia, have move on to bicycles. The major of Bogota(a city in colombia) said that due to the limitation of cars for a day ""It has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"". This is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars. This means that transport would be so much more affordable. Now with the increase in bicycle travel, there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic. And although cars are much faster than bicycles, the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel, bicycle travel will be more efficient. This ultimately means that by limiting car usage, transportation will be cheaper, and it will be just as efficient, if not more. It can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel, but David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes. By limiting car usage, these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation. Indeed in the end  Vauban is correct in calling this ""smart planning"".

Now comes out the benefits everyone knows about: the environmental benefits. Smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world. In countries such as China, it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog, daily. But what may not be as common to people is that a country such as France has also started to see a similiar problem. Pollution in France is actually rivaled by Beijing(one of the most polluted countries in the world) as reported by the Chicago tribune on 2014. Cars have been the major cause of this, considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by cars. In fact an article named ""The end of car culture"" states that cars are one of the highest sources for carbon emissions. By limiting car usage, cities such as Bogota and Paris, faced amazing results. Overall by limiting car usage the environment benefits exponentially.

In the end the solution to the people choking in the world, is simple: limiting car usage. The advantages of this limitation can be seen with benefits to socitey. This can be seen with public benefits, cheaper and time saving methods and of course the environmental benefits.                                            ","

F-M260,"We all need to have a break right? Well,now Google wants to create a driverless car in the future. In this argumentative essay I will talk about how we should have driverless cars in the future and how beneficial it can be.

I think that driverless cars are better and they should be allowed because some people drive from twelve hours to there destination and even thirty-two hours from their destination. I would say it is a good idea because some familys take road trips and the driver is usually very tired after hours of driving in the same position. According to paragraph one,Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that such cars would fundementally change the world,and personally,it could change my dads world. Also,we need driverless cars becuase some people drive at night and their sight and brain can be unconscious and have a wreck. Driving at night can be and will be very exhausting,but if you are too tired to even pay attention to the road,the best thing to do is to lay down in your car and let the car do its own thing.

Another reason I think it should be allowed is because of all the reckless driving there is in this world. Of course,according to paragraph seven,Google didnt extend the possibilites of having a successful driverless car. They just made the driverless car not really driverless. I mean,in paragraph seven it states clearly that the car will have a sensor in order for the passenger in the drivers seat to take action whenever there is an accident or upcoming traffic. In someway it sounds helpful but in another way it just sounds as if the driver is still driving no matter what. They should create driverless cars becuase some people have accidents and can result in death. So,to avoid that we need those driverless cars,we need something that can be useful for people who are seniors and when they are drunk or are just learning to drive. Also,we do need it for the people who take road trips or the people who have business trips and just have to drive for hours.

My third reason on which we should have driverless cars is that we might want to see and enjoy the view of the outside. The passangers are not a problem when coming to viewing the outside world through their window,but the passanger will get exhausted just looking straight infront of him. We need to think that the driver also wants a little taste of what is out there to see. Like my dad,he likes to see out in the window but he cant because he has to keep his focus infront of his. Our brain can also go to a point where it can get exhausted and they eyesight fails some of the time it fails and the accidents happen.

In conclusion,we should have driverless cars because they will be useful for all of us,especially the ones who have to drive for hours just to get to their destination. It will also be helpful for the people who drive at night. Some people cant even see at night and they just crash. So,I think that we should have driverless cars because it will be beneficial for all of us.","

""[Essay Content: F-M260 / We all need to have a break right? Well,now Google wants to create a driverless car in the future. In this argumentative essay I will talk about how we should have driverless cars in the future and how beneficial it can be.

I think that driverless cars are better and they should be allowed because some people drive from twelve hours to there destination and even thirty-two hours from their destination. I would say it is a good idea because some familys take road trips and the driver is usually very tired after hours of driving in the same position. According to paragraph one,Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that such cars would fundementally change the world,and personally,it could change my dads world. Also,we need driverless cars becuase some people drive at night and their sight and brain can be unconscious and have a wreck. Driving at night can be and will be very exhausting,but if you are too tired to even pay attention to the road,the best thing to do is to lay down in your car and let the car do its own thing.

Another reason I think it should be allowed is because of all the reckless driving there is in this world. Of course,according to paragraph seven,Google didnt extend the possibilites of having a successful driverless car. They just made the driverless car not really driverless. I mean,in paragraph seven it states clearly that the car will have a sensor in order for the passenger in the drivers seat to take action whenever there is an accident or upcoming traffic. In someway it sounds helpful but in another way it just sounds as if the driver is still driving no matter what. They should create driverless cars becuase some people have accidents and can result in death. So,to avoid that we need those driverless cars,we need something that can be useful for people who are seniors and when they are drunk or are just learning to drive. Also,we do need it for the people who take road trips or the people who have business trips and just have to drive for hours.

My third reason on which we should have driverless cars is that we might want to see and enjoy the view of the outside. The passangers are not a problem when coming to viewing the outside world through their window,but the passanger will get exhausted just looking straight infront of him. We need to think that the driver also wants a little taste of what is out there to see. Like my dad,he likes to see out in the window but he cant because he has to keep his focus infront of his. Our brain can also go to a point where it can get exhausted and they eyesight fails some of the time it fails and the accidents happen.

In conclusion,we should have driverless cars because they will be useful for all of us,especially the ones who have to drive for hours just to get to their destination. It will also be helpful for the people who drive at night. Some people cant even see at night and they just crash. So,I think that we should have driverless cars because it will be beneficial for all of us.]""

F-M263,"I think using this technology in a classroom would be a huge breakthrough. Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or he needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. So the teacher can modify the way he teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.

This technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.

Humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now. For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how his face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.

In conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.                                 ","

One reason why I thik is valuable for a classroom is because it can see if you happy, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Last reason is teachers can communicate with their students better and understand them, if he knows the way they are feeling. The teacher could help the student by giving him space or time alone and not be so hard on him.

In the passage i said that unrra hired ""Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young bulls, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his uncle farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals.

I think that Luke and Don had a good reason to join that program.

Why i think that because they get to see alot of different things they never seen before. Also in the passage is states that Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been uploaded. He said being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. He says "" i'm gratefull for the opportunity.""","

F-M268,"Have you ever thought of reading expressions but by the use of technology.? Today scientist have created a system that helps read expressions. It reads six basic emotions and many others like happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. Do you think is should be used for classrooms?

Mona Lisa is an example of the use of the Facial Action Coding System. They detected that he was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Also, this system is the use to recognize emotions that was invented by Prof. Thomas Huang. The process

of this is when the computer conduct a 3-D model face. The Facial Action Coding System recognize the emotions of Mona Lisa. Computers chould do the same. As a matter of fact, a computer should know how you are feeling towards the ads and webs. In the article, Dr. Huang states that

""A computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then is could modify the lession, like an effective human instructor"". However, this system could also be used to make computer animations faces ""more expressive"". Lastly, this system could be useful for schools because it will know how students will feel towards the lessons.

In conlusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be used for classrooms. To begin with, It shows that Mona Lisa was a great example or the use of this system. It detected of how he was feeling. So when a computer detects a students face of a ad, it will know what he/he don't like. In fact, just by using our minds will be difficult to describe an emotion but by the use of this would be a great help. ","

F-M269,"These article that are given to me have good reasons why we may not need cars as time passes by, and their advantages.

In the first article, it gives many reasons why some people in Germany dont need, or used cars. In the third paragraph, second sentence, a men states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Meaning, that he probably had a lot of issues when he had a car, maybe it was engine problems, battery, or maybe the gas prices that they used to have, but now he can relaxe, not having to deal with any engine problems, battery problems, or the gas prices, now that he doesn't own a car. Now he probably just has a bike, and bike are really easy to fix, not like a car were you have to pay someone to fix it for you, also pay for items that the person fixing your car has used. Basically some people in Germany are trying to save money, and have found a way to do it.

Next, the second article and the third article, take on one of the most important thing, our planet. In the two article it gives alot of reasons why a car is banned from Paris and Bogota, Colombia, but the one that captures me the most would be on the paragraph 17, were it states ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Showing that Paris has noticed a problem and are actually doing something about it. They have banned cars to see if that is the actual problem, and they have found out that the cars are the problem. And they're answer to that problem is to set a fine to those people that had their cars with even numbered licence plates on Mondays and odd numbered licenced plates on the following day. Paris then got the results, if the cars were the problem, and yes it was, there was less smog, so they had decided to leave the fine. And in the third article, it shows that also Colombia is taking part of a smog free place. But they instead decide to ban cars and only give permission to buses and taxi drivers to drive. But they don't only give bus drivers and taxi drivers osmething to enjoy, the have also given their people ways to enjoy a place without cars. They have fixed their old, beat-up sidewalks and have put more bicycle trails for people that don't drive buses or taxis.

Last but not least, in the last article it shows that even a powerful and strong nation can also take part of helping the planet, by lowering its most known culture, driving. It might seem like America is taking a part of helping the planet, by lowering the number of cars, and drivers. The statement that captures my attention the most would be ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."" Meaning that a nation were young people would come to lead it in the future, some have decided to do it by hard work. Some would lead it by doign it in the hard, but basically simple way, driving.

In conclusion, those are my reasons to why limiting car usage have its advantages, by saving money, peoples lives, and our planet.    ","

F-M270,"I think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classrooms because it would help to see the emotions of kids. Like see if they need help or if they aren't feeling good. Mostly things like that. You could also use it to see if kids are lying or not when they get in trouble and have to go to the principle or when they get in trouble at home.

Mona Lisa: 83% happy, 9% disgusted , 6% fearful, and 3% angry! When Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 we had no clue how he was really feeling. But with the FACS it is now easy to see how he was feeling. That is a good thing because it could help us in the future with life or death situations.

When we ask questions like ""Can we actually 'calculate' emotions like we calculate math problems? or ""How can a simple computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans have to use and show how we feel? shows that we humans need this type of cool technology in the future to make things easier than what they are nowadays!","

F-M271,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", brings the reader to light on the argument on whether or not scientist should keep trying land spacecrafts or humans on Venus.

An arguement can be made for either side and is just a matter of opionion.

The author conveys his opionion well in the passages, but he doesn't make a compelling case for his side of the argument. The author doesn't give enough reasonable support to back up his claims.

To begin with, the amount of danger that is on Venus's surface and atmosphere poses too big of a challenge for scientists to reasonably accomplish. As it says in the passage, Venus is converes in almost 97% carbon dioxide and the temperature and pressure arounf 90 times greater than what we usually experience on Earth, making Venus's surface temperature around 800 degree. If anyone probes that touchdown on Venus don't get destoyed by any of those, there's a likely chance it'll get destroyed by its frequent lighting storms, earthquakes and volcanoes.

The author claim to the soultion to these challenges are also highly unrealistic. The author states that humans can explore Venus by contructing a vehicle that hovers 30+ miles above the surface. The author gives this solution but doesn't give any support to how it will be accomplished and doesn't give answer to questions like, ""How will they transport a blimp to Mars?"", "" How they enter Mars atmophere without landing first?"" or ""What will power this?"" (If it's constantly in the air that will takeup a lot of fuel.)

One last backset to the author's plan is, how will it be funded? The bills will start racking up everytime a probe is destroyed by Venus's surface and they have to spend millions of more dollars building and sending another spacecraft to Venus. No countries or companies want to spend billions of dollars on a mission that they mat have a chancce of lerning some information about Mars.

The author goals and solutions are just too unrealistics with this day and age's technologies. It is advanced but not advanced to overcome the obsticals that Vensus present. Some day in the future we may be advance enough to achieve this goal.","

Even thought it's a dangerous mission if we send more unmaned ships and drones to venus we could find a easier way to send the first human there.

The author also sates some of the downsides such as ""A thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus."" And he also states ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degress fahrenheit."" which would be deadly for any human without a special suit. Even though this mission could put

somebody's life at risk is could still be a huge leap forward for space travel and the exploration of the universe. If the world were to ever collaspe unto itself we as a race would need to sutible planet to make our new home, And if we make venus safe for humans in my opinion that would be one of the top choices.

In conclusion venus is a very dangerous planet, but if scientist just study the planet for a long time, We might be able to make it suitable for a man or man to finally explore the surface of our "" Brother Planet."" This may take years or even centuries but the author firmly believes that if we just keep sending ships and drones that we can have enough knowlege to explore the planet further.","

F-M273,"I think the idea of being able to see other kids emotions or feelings from a computer is a bad idea. No one should know what the kid is going through unless that kid wants you to know he or he will tell you.

If the kid wants it to be private or can't tell anyone anything then they don't want others to know at all. If they are mad they shouldn't take it out on someone else. They could maybe ask a close friend or teacher or parent for help or ask them what they should do. He or he could be going through a lot at home or with grades or a bully that makes he or he mad. Parents need to ask there kids and wonder are they doing ok in school is everything alright if there kid is showing emotions for being mad or sad then they should be concerned. Most kids will be to scared to tell others cause they think they will get into trouble so they just stay quiet. Some kids take the pain out on there selfs and harm there selfs or worse. The kid shouldn't be asking what to do cause they are to scared. The guardian, teacher, friend or someone close should be asking them are you ok or im here for you then the kid will speak up and talk.

My opion on whether the computer should read kids expressions is no that's the parents job or guardian computers don't run are life's and the guardian should know if there kid is doing ok or not and help them instead of a computer helping them on there life situations.","

F-M274,"Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom. First it could appeal differently to each students larning style, or be modified to teach him/his how the student wants. Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/he likes the lesson. This could help children learn alot better in a learning enviroment tailored just for them.

First, it could appeal differently to each student. This means that if it notices a kid frowning when showed a hard problem or a large group of text, it could change what it is doing but keeps the concept of what it is teaching. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" This shows that the program could be used for the betterment of teaching for different people, not all people learn the same way, so why should it all be taught the same way. The computer could fix that by modifying the way it teaches.

Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/he likes the lesson. If a student, me especially, dosen't like a lesson or thinks it is boring, he/he wont learn. A computer that reads faces to get the emotions of students would keep the lesson being taught livley and more fun to keep students entertained. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" I used the same quote twice once in the second paragraph and now, in this paragraph becauses it strongly supports both of my claims. If a computer where to ""modify the lesson, like an effective instructor"" students would always be engaged in learning because the lesson would always change to what is needed to keep students entertained.

Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom. If used in a classroom, it would greatly keep students engaged in learning. personally, I would love having something like this in the classroom to keep me interested in the lesson. Wraped up, having this tool would greatly improve the entirety of the school learning enviroment. ","

Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/he likes the lesson. This could help children learn alot better in a learning enviroment tailored just for them.

First, it could appeal differently to each student. This means that if it notices a kid frowning when showed a hard problem or a large group of text, it could change what it is doing but keeps the concept of what it is teaching. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" This shows that the program could be used for the betterment of teaching for different people, not all people learn the same way, so why should it all be taught the same way. The computer could fix that by modifying the way it teaches.

Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/he likes the lesson. If a student, me especially, dosen't like a lesson or thinks it is boring, he/he wont learn. A computer that reads faces to get the emotions of students would keep the lesson being taught livley and more fun to keep students entertained. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" I used the same quote twice once in the second paragraph and now, in this paragraph becauses it strongly supports both of my claims. If a computer where to ""modify the lesson, like an effective instructor"" students would always be engaged in learning because the lesson would always change to what is needed to keep students entertained.

Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom. If used in a classroom, it would greatly keep students engaged in learning. personally, I would love having something like this in the classroom to keep me interested in the lesson. Wraped up, having this tool would greatly improve the entirety of the school learning enviroment. ]""

F-M275,"""Paul"", Luke said ""do you want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program?""

""Uhm I'm not sure luke, why would I join the Seagoing Cowboys program, like give me an idea of what it would be like"" Paul said

""Well you get to help out Europe and China by giving them horses, baby bulls, goats and so on."", Luke said, ""You also get to see so many natural wonders, antiques, buildings from long long ago, and meet so many new and great people""

""Sounds fun but what about my kids and husband,they will miss me, and who will be man of the house after all I only have two boys with a father that is sick. I'm sorry Luke I just can't go to many things to worry about"".

""Well why didn't you tell me that i would've got that taken care of no questions asked"", Luke said, ""I can call up your brother have him come up here and take care of the house and call a docter to take care of your husband, I know you would've called a docter if you had the money to, but I will pay for the docter visiting so you don't have to woory about money"".

In the meantime Luke called Dr. Philipe, (phil-EY-pay) called Saul, Paul's brother, asked if he could house sit for Paul, and payed for the docter visit and Saul's trip.

""So Paul, now can you go?"", Luke said

""Yes I can go"", said Paul

On the way to the Luke's barn that was on a hil next to the lake, they found multiple holes in the ground that hadn't been there before. ""I wonder where these came from?""

""Me too, maybe a giant worm or a mole"", Paul said

""Let's follow the holes to see where the main source is"". They followed the holes and it led them to the barn. They heard a lot of noise from the horses then the bulls and then the chickens. ""What's going on in here"", Luke said. ALmost right after he said that he spotted a cottenmouth snake on of the most deadliest snakes of all, besides the viper.

""Oh my chicken nuggets, it's a snake"", Paul screamed. The snake heard Paul scream and turned around to face Paul. The sake bunched up and Luke said, ""Run!"" Paul was to late. The snake bit him on his ankle and Paul fell to the floor. Luke grabbed an iron horse shoe and threw it at the snake, missed the first time, but the second hit the snake in the head.

""Get away from my friend!"" Yelled Luke, ""Or I'll through another one!"" The snake just stayed there hissing at Luke. Luke threw another one and hit the snake again and killed the snake. Luke threw the dead snake out of the barn and got all the venom out of Paul.

""Lets go now"", Luke said. They left and was on the boat untill one of the horses saw a spider and ran towrds land. ""Let's just leave it after all we have 337 horses"", said Paul.

They left and was having the time of their lifes, seeing all type of sea creatures and weird fish. They made it to Europe and delived the animals safe and sound.

""So did you have fun?"" asked Luke.

""Yes, it is fun to get out of the house and two screaming boys and enjoy life while we still can"", said Paul

They made it to homeland and had the best welcome back party of their lifes. Luke said bye to Paul when Paul went on his next trip and Luke went home to do house chores. They never saw each other again because it was said that there was a storm that year and the SS WiIlington 370 capsized in the water and was never seen again.

F-M276,"Dear state senator,

By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts . I belive that some of the people that do want to become president someday will not become that because their votes mainly deals with the electoral colloges and what they really when the counts of the votes should be really counted off what the people of the united states really think or who they think our president should really be. Some people think we should have a black president or a white president green,purple,or blue it really doesnt matter in my opinion i think i am speaking for everyone when i say that wewant a person that would make great descisions for the umited states a person that is welling to go above and beyond to make our countrymore better and a safe place to all . And at the end of the day people in america doesnt want or think that it is right to have a male president sitting in the seat of a president,i say simply because the people of the USA doesnt think men have enough power or orders, or authority i think men should have the same rights as men. But at the end of the day i think that the people of the united states should have a right to choose who they want to serve as or president , someone who would make change and make the USA a better and safer place for everyone. Someone whois very well educated and have a outlook or reach of things. It shouldnt be based off the electoral colleges because america might disagree with their descison and cause a whole lot of chaos.         ","

F-M277,"I think that using the techonogy to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable because it help to see if a student is happy/mad/sad .Like in the passage it's talking about how they are using this new technology call ''The Facial Action coding system ''Which mean -a system enables computers to identify human emotions . They are aslo using the 3-D computer model of the face ,As they can aslo calculate the emotions . As because you can see what is wrong with your friend/family .

One reason why I think it's valuable for technology to read your emontional expressoion on studnets is by the promgram ''Facial Action Coding System'' why because just by using a video as it sates in the passage 4 ''using video imagery the new eemotion recognition software tracks these facial movements ''they can see what kind of emontion you have and for them to help you out I am guessing or at less it can be valube for making them feel better .Also because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them .I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my dad/daad get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad .

It aslo can be valuable for student's in school because in that way you can help them out to feel better or sometines you just don't know wehn that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling .Another reason why it can help on students with the new technolongy by the imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by the imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad .This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way becasue sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know should't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by casuing harm .As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example .''If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow .But if you frown the next ad will be different .''A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored '' As Dr. Hiangs predicts then he could modity thr lesson because they want the student's to pay attion in the classroom for them to learn and not make the class boring or for student to get lost and never asking question but as that to then the teacher will know what makes them get bored and what makes them get fouces . This will help for many toher student in school by not causing hram if they mad and aslo by helping student not get bored or lose fouces .

Now on my personal life I will say that the technolngy will help me by seeing how are people feeling when I see them walking around with there face down or just seeing them happy .Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hall way and see my freind wih a serious face or just them not talking to I will like to use the technolgy and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood .Another reason why I will like to help is by seeing how does my dad feel when he looks at me like just take a picture of his and see what are the emotion he has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make his look at his self in the mirror and follow the steps it say and see what are the emotion he has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expressio for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many awlays

As you see I do valuable the technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a class because it can help in many way to see the way they are feeling in there emotion and in there way of learing .Just like Dr. Huang he doesnt want his student to lose fouces and doesnt want them to feel sad either .Just like it will help in school for the student's .Also as using the 3-D computer mood just by seeing an imagine it can see what kind of feeling you are having . As yes it will be value to use later in ;life well it will help me with my friends and even my own kids and students at schools .    ","

F-M278,"Would you risk your life to search for answers that might just end up dissapointing you? Well I'm asssuming that the author of this article would. The author talks more about the bad things about Venus than the good things, which doesn't help his/his claim that it ""is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". In this article, the author talks more about the hardships Venus's enviroment would provide than the benefits, he/he talks about how hard it would be to build a spacecraft to even withstand Venus's envirmonet, and he/he doesnt't provide any points or ideas to why we should want to visit there.

The author mentions that Venus's atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide. Not only is the atmosphere 97 percent carbon dioxide, it also contains ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"". Temperatures on Venus average around 800 degrees fahrenheit, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet, which would be impossible to maintian human life, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times what we have here on earth. All of paragraph 3 is just talking about the negative's of Venus, which doesn't support the authors claim that these risks are worth finding out any information.

In paragraph five, the author talks about how NASA is trying to build a spacecraft that can withstand Venus's envirmonet. He/he explains in paragraph 2 that no spacecraft that has been sent to Venus has ever survived the landing for more than a few hours. The author talks about how NASA wants to build a blimp that will hover 30 miles above the surface of Venus so that is can avoid the harsh conditions on the surface, although right after this, he/he states that even 30 miles up off the surface, Venus is still going to be around 170 degrees Farenheit. The extremly high air pressure, heat, harsh storms, etc will all have to be concidered when trying to build a spacecraft that will be able to survive on Venus. Once again, these paragraphs are not explainging much good that is coming out of a manned trip to Venus.

Throughout the article, the author talks about very little benefits that come when sending a man to Venus. Scientists do believe that Venus was once covered with large oceans and might have had a variety of life forms. But this means nothing to us now if it's all destroyed. We will never for sure know if there was once life there, all of the evidence is gone. Honestly, what is the point in even going to Venus? Temperatures of 800 degrees would have burnt everything. Besides, why does is matter to us if there was once life there? We should focus on Earth and how we need to start taking care of it, before it ends up like Venus. There was no solid point in this article that honestly pursuaded me to want to send someone to visit Venus.

In conclusion, I do not think the author supported his claim well, he talked more about the negative parts of Venus, about how hard it would be to build something to trasport them there, and he/he never really states anything persuading the reader about why it would be good to visit Venus. Although it would be intresting to find out stuff about Venus's past, no one will ever know the absolute truth. ","

F-M279,"Humans must continue to study Venus as it is know to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. With NASA stating that it is possible to send humans to Venus, we must do it to gather information on how Venus use to be like Earth and then how it became impossible to live on. The author uses logos to inform the reader on how to get a human to Venus. If a human were to go to venus he/he would stay about thirty miles above the surface where it is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure is normal and solar power would be very useful. With these conditions it is possible to send a human to Venus.

Although Venus can be accessed by humans, the information scientist really want is on the surface. Sending a human to the surface is death but, scientist are working on a machine made of silicon carbide. The silicon carbide material can withstand the awful conditions of Venus for about 3 weeks. 3 weeks is enough time to gather rocks, dust, gas, and other objects on the surface. All of this information that the author says is building a compeling reason to study Venus.

The author does a great job pursuading the reader into wanting to explore Venus. He/he uses the rhetorical strategy pathos when he/he said that Venus is the most Earth-like planet and that the misson is survivable for humans. That gets the reader wanting to see how it all ended for Venus and also, makes the reader feel excited in wanting to learn more. The author also states strategys to the process of exploring Venus which gives the reader hope that it can happen.","

F-M280,"I think it is valuable to use this technology in schools or what ever there is they want to know or use them for or even on other things, beacuse you want to know if your students are sad or what they are feeling like on a day to day bases.

Since some kids dont really tell you whats going on with their life, and you see them sad or crying but they wont tell you what they are feeling like. So I think you can use these. I think students will find very interesting these computer models, beacuse they have 3-D cumputer models that recognize their faces and get every little muscle of their face to make almost like a replica in order to see the facil expressions you make, like when the cumputer recognises your face it shows if you like something or not like the ads on your phone.

If you like it it shows more like those you just watched, but sometimes In my opinion, feel like it just wants you to stay on your phone and kepp being on it, and I find it kind of creepy that it knows your face and the way you feel. But for the most part teen and other people would like these in a cool way to use. Just like they tried using it on a Mona Lisa painting to see what he was feeling back then, beacause he looked like he was very mad at somthing.

But other wise i think it will be great and i think they should use them in schools. I find it very interesting for many students and myself to use, I think they should allow it in many schools         ","

What something people don't know is the painting of the man actually shows different emotions by moving parts of his face. For many decades, people from all over the world are attracted and have experienced the same thing. Years later, a group of scientists named Dr. Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe started to calculate human facial movements by computer. They wanted to show how people feel back in the past decades. In addition, what people call the artwork Mona Lisa ""the only moving picture ever existed."" No matter where you are, no matter where you stand, Mona Lisa can still stare at you.

F-M287,"The author supports his or his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents by explaining why Venus should be studied ,the reasons why studying Venus is difficult, and the solutions to the problems caused by the climate of Venus.

The author supports his or his idea by stating the reasons why Venus should be explored. The author states in paragraph 4, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" The reason stated supports the authors idea because without a reason to study Venus there would likely be very little reason to justify studing Venus without a proper incentive.

The author further supports his or his idea by explaining why studying Venus would be so difficult. The author explains in paragraph 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" If there were no explanation on why it would be diffucult to study Venus there would be no way for scientists to figure out solutions to the various problems of studying Venus.

The author then goes on to explain possible solutions for the obstacles of studing Venus. The author states in paragraph 7, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."" The author also states in paragraph 7, ""...some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" By explaining possible solutions the author proves that there is hope in studying and that attempting to study Venus isn't a futile effort.

The author supports his or his idea to study Venus by explaining why Venus should be studied, why it is so difficult to study Venus, and by explaining possible solutions to studing Venus. if there were no reason to study Venus then Venus wouldn't even be attempted study.

F-M288,"As the world begins to grow and expand, many people have found that living without cars can be more beneficial. Cities and suburbs around the world, have found that reducing car usage has a grest number of advantages. This is reducing pollution, and is reducing stress. The world is shifting into a new way of life, not involving cars.

Cars release a large amout of greenhouse gases into the atmospere every single day, and this is harming the environment. Experts explain that, ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Rosenthal), have been taking place in suburban communities in Germany. This has resulted with a, ""12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal). Also, Paris has seen near-record amounts of pollution and smog in the city, so the global city has limited motorists' driving on two days of the week, Monday and Tuesday. The climate in Paris, ""[causes] the warm layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Duffer), thoughout the atmospere in the city, but the limitation on motorists at the beginning of the week has allowed the smog to clear up.

Helping the environment is not the only benefit of reducing car usage, yet it can also relieve stress in your eveeryday life. There is no need to stress out over traffic, finding somewhere to park, or even paying the expences that come with owning a car. In Germany, most residents don't own cars, and Heidrun Walter explained that he is, ""much happier this way"" (Rosenthal), because he doesnt have to worry about traffic. He has enjoyed a healthier life style that is stress free, by walking or biking to the places he needs to be. In Colombia, there is a day that citizens will not use cars, once a year. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees that, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" (Selsky). There is no need to worry about rush hour, or other traffic.

Others don't see the advantages of reducing car usage. Delivery companies complain about the loss in revenue, yet they aren't thinking about the benefits. They can save their employees from stressing out, or even help the environment. Reducing car usage would be a huge cultural shift, that has many advantages.    ","

F-M290,"Using this new facial technology would be vastly benefital in the classroom. Students sit through seven hours of school a day and not every class is going to be their favorite, with this technology the school can figure out what lessons, classes, and teachers are making students the happiest and are the best. Many emotions go undetected, they cause bad grades, lack of motivation, and depression. Not only can the program detect emotions but can alert the teachers if a student needs help. It can prevent self harm, school targeties, and safety hazards. The system would not only help education wise but mental health wise, and create a safe environment to learn and grow as people.

Everyone has a different learning style, and if a teacher can see that that student is struggling and adjust the lesson for them, it would be very benefital for eveyone. Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". Many teachers ask thier students to ask questions as they are learning new content, but no questions are ever asked and bad tests scores come back. This could of all been avoided if the program could have seen the bored expression on a students face and a teacher could have changed it to prevent him from falling asleep. Or the confused look on a boys face, so the teacher could have come to help his instead of his asking for help from a friend who misinformed his. The computer program can take all the error out of emotion calculation, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect.""(5). We would become far more accurate as a whole group, eveyone learning in school could become more inteligent, and we would become happier people.

If the computer could detect a worried or sad emotion, the people around them could resolve the issue much faster and prevent anything bad from happrning. Our society as a whole would be far more advanced and left off better if we integrate this new advancemnt into our everyday lives. School could be turned into a place every student wants to go, and the success rate could also be increasing, with the new lessons and teaching styles being integrated for students.

F-M291,"Emotions are what you feel on a daily basis sometimes you can be happy and something you can be sad. In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" students from the University of Illinois collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. They developed better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can how how the student is feeling and it can help see if the student is enjoying what it is learning.

One facial expression can give it all away of how you are feeling. Facial Action Coding System can identify mixed emotions, each expression that is being made is compared to a neutal face that is not showing any emotional. If a student is having a bad day or something is wrong with them the software will instantly let them know how they are feeling. As in the painting ""Mona Lisa"" they were not sure what his emotions ""he's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

Another reason it is valuable is it can help see if a student is enjoying what it is doing. For example in the passage it says ""A classroom computer coul recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If that were to happen it would be able to modify the lesson such a effective human intructor.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Examples of why it is vaulable are while a student is working on a lesson the computer can find out how a student is feeling and seeing if a student is enjoying what he or he is learning.

F-M293,"Mona Lisa has always been a very important 'mentleman' since we were in elementry, but who thought of his bringing an idea to mind when it comes to science? He is a piece of art, so why does this old painting become art? Well if we talk about the mastermind or understand what he is saying, then that may anwser some questions. It can also make us reconsider the technology that we have today.

According to a computer program mona Losa is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" In other words the Mona Lisa's intention was actually supposed to make you happy, but why does this make him want to start the program? Well he noticed the way that the computer was detecting his emotions and to began to wonder about science in computers.

The author learing about him then began to think of how it could be changed and what it could do. the author though

Maybe if you smile it could show the happy adds. If you were sad however, there could be diffrent adds as well. After thinking this over and over the author began to think of other things like how video games expressions could be more alive.

Then came the idea of how this could happen and what could be changed. The author mentions that it can't be easy for a PC to just go and reconize it off the bat, but if it were to be programed with basic steps then it might work. The author believes that this can make our everyday lives better, but how so? Knowing all of the stuff we went through, we still wonder how so. So then what better way to give an final example; ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student ios becoming confused or bored,"" Said the master mind of this idea.

In conclusion it is better to have a computer to help us create a emtion reading enviorment. It can help us in many ways and make the world more happy. This way would be so much better to show the way a mind works and help mpre scientist undrstand the brain. This can even lead to more dsicoveries that us human haven't reached yet and maybe make us a smarter country in return.       ","

So then what better way to give an final example; ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student ios becoming confused or bored,"" Said the master mind of this idea.

In conclusion it is better to have a computer to help us create a emtion reading enviorment. It can help us in many ways and make the world more happy. This way would be so much better to show the way a mind works and help mpre scientist undrstand the brain. This can even lead to more dsicoveries that us human haven't reached yet and maybe make us a smarter country in return.       ]""

F-M294,"The question is, is this technology valuable to telling what a student in a classroom is feeling? Can it actually tell how someone is feeling by their facial expression? I think, no. I mean what is the big deal here? They can't actually tell what a person is feeling, right? Well I for sure do not think so.

Of course you can look at someone and think they are sad by what they are saying or how they look, but they can obviously be acting like that to hide the fact that they are happy. Or the oppostie. Many, many people hide that they are sad with a big smile on their face. I just think this technology is pointless because people hide their emotions all the time. I know I do.

For example, say you are at a family get together, and you feel unhappy about something, but your dad wants to take a family photo. You're going to smile in the picture but that does not neccisarily mean you feel happy. Or for a school picture. You could be upset about something but of course you are not going to show that in a picture everyone is going to see. And why would you use the painting of Mona Lisa as an example. It is a painting! He might be smiling becasue that is how the artist wanted his to look but he doesn't feel that way!

""Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". Sounds like he knows his stuff, but does he really? I agree that he can tell if a person looks sad, happy, mad, disgusted, surprised, or scared, but is that how they're really feeling? I'd like to see them calculate how they actually feel. Until then, my opinion is that this is pointless.

""A renowned drama coach, Constanin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". Exactly, acting is all it takes. That sentence from the article pretty much proves my point. So overall, in my opinion, I think this is not valuable at all and it shouldn't be used in a classroom to see how a student feels. It won't work.         ","

F-M295,"Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our enviornment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our enviornment with the air pollution; you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.

First and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""(14). The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the enviornment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates (11). That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution (20). Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, ""[i]t's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (24).

In addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn't be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful enviornment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said he was always tense and now he is happy without his car, because he can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing (3). Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I'm inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my father gas money.

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn't just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" (9). If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the enviornment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don't know if its really worth the risk.                                                                                                    ","

F-M296,"The thought of driverless cars is amazing. Are there more dangers than what we think? If the car is supposed to alert the drive what happens if it fails to do so in enough time to stop the crash? If it is driverless your kids could start the car and leave they wouldnt need to even touch the wheel. Driverless cars are a great idea but the dangers and other factors have not been depated yet.

Just think it drives itself, your son wants to go somewhere and you wont take his. He could turn the car on and set a destination anywhere and the car would take his there. You lost your car to an eight year old who couldnt reach the pedals. Now if the car had to be driven by a person he wouldnt have been able to leave. Also if your sick and dizzy and you need to go to the hospital your car could take you there. If someone is injured and you have to help them while the car is moving thats another advantage.

Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel.

A teenager who DOES NOT know how to drive is supposed to steal a car for a gang as an initiation. He knows what the new driverless car looks like. Its the new car you just bout for 30 Thousand dollors. He brakes into the car and turns it on and sets the destination for the gangs warehouse. It drives itself there. He wouldnt have gotten the car there if it didnt drive itself.

What if the car doesnt stop at the lights and it causes an accident? Three people are injured two end up dieing. It could have been prevented if the driver of the driverless car was paying attention to the road. With the driverless car how many people do you really think will still pay attention to the road. This is a waste of taxe and government money. If we are going to use our money on something it should be to make gas cheaper, help veterans who are homeless, the wounded warriors who give us the freedom to spend money.

Driverless cars yes will change the world but i doubt it is for the better. Kids wont need to have drivers lisence if the car drives itself. How would we know that the vehicle is going to help us and not cause more wrecks.   ","

F-M298,"Today, many people all around the world rely too heavily on their cars.  There are many great reasons that car usage should be limited.  Car usage should be decreased because owning a car can be stressful, dangerous, and cars give off unwanted gas and pollution.  Although cars have been used for many years, it is not too late to take action on this problem.

Many people today would agree that buying and maintaining a car is very stressful.  It is very expensive to own a car, and it takes a lot of hard work to keep the car in good shape.  ""I am much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter (Rosenthal, 3).  Walter states that he is much happier without a car due to all the stress that comes with owning a car.  Walter also states that while he had a car, he was ""always tense,"" (Rosenthal, 3).  This is probably because of the expenses and time he had to sacrifice while trying to take good care of his vehicle.  This includes buying the car, paying for gas and insuance, repairs, and washing it.  People will save themselves a lot of time and money if the amount of car usage is limited.

Not only are cars are stressful to maintain, but they are also very dangerous to operate.  People run the risk of severe accidents every day when they drive their car.  In Source 4, the author states that new forms of public transportation will ""improve safety,"" (Rosenthal, 43).  The most occuring accidents are car accidents, which happen everyday.  Families will have to worry less about losing people they are close to.  There will be less unecessary accidents, such as drunk driving, and using phones while behind the wheel.  By reducing the amount of drivers on the road, the risk of these accidents will become much lower.

One last reason that car usage should be limited is that cars give off lots of unwanted gas and pollution into the air.  Recently, Paris faced ""near-record pollution,"" (Duffer, 10).  This was caused by the extreme amount of emissions from their cars.  The main cause for people wanting to reduce the use of cars is because of this unhealthy gas.  Cities all over the world are making efforts to help reduce and prevent the emissions.  The only way to do this is limit the usage of cars.  ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" (Rosenthal, 34).  If the change can be made, then it should, in order to keep the environment safe.  There isn't much time before the pollution gets out of hand.

Although so many people rely on cars so much, they do not see the advantages of not using them.  Most people don't put into consideration how harmful these vehicles are to the environment.  On top of that, they cause uneeded stress and danger.  Because of these reasons,  the usage of cars should be limited.

F-M299,"The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable from three reasons in the article that the author tells us by reading this article.

It's interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. In paragraph 3, the author says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.

The author tells in the text, ""We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."" But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look. It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.

From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how he's feeling and how he looks. There would be multiple guesses on how his face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that he looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture.

Moreover, the article gives us a lot of information of the advanced technological computer that constructs a 3-D model, to scan a human face and tell how the person feels emotionally. It's amazing and interesting to even read about Dr. Huang and Prof. Sebe ,his colleague, are both experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.","

A student submitted the following essay:

""[Essay Content: F-M299 / The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable from three reasons in the article that the author tells us by reading this article.

It's interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. In paragraph 3, the author says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.

The author tells in the text, ""We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."" But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look. It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.

From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how he's feeling and how he looks. There would be multiple guesses on how his face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that he looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture.

Moreover, the article gives us a lot of information of the advanced technological computer that constructs a 3-D model, to scan a human face and tell how the person feels emotionally. It's amazing and interesting to even read about Dr. Huang and Prof. Sebe ,his colleague, are both experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.]""

F-M300,"In the article ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" the author

has explained and backed up his idea of studying Venus excellently. The author used clear facts of the harms and conditions that Venus has and why we can't just enter without protection. While the author was stating these facts he also was coming up with ideas of what NASA and other scientist are doing to better the chances of human beings going there and studying the Earth-like planet. The author continuously kept stating ideas of what human being could do to study Venus and not once said that we couldnt. The author was also very confident about his idea everytime he tought of one idea another one was on deck, just in-case one plan didnt seem so possible to humans.

In Paragraphs 1-5 the author is constantly stating facts of what Venus

is now and the harms and conditions that it has. Paragraph 3 it stated mostly why humans can't be there to live or just to study. Paragraph 3 stated for example,''on the planets surface, temperature average pver 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our planet.'' It also stated, that ''these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.'' He/He is baisically stating that the atmoshere and surface temp. is far more for a human to be there studying or living without ssome use of technology.

As the author states harms and conditions he/he also starts to

think of some ways us humans can build some technology of some sort to get us the information we need from the studyings of this planet. He/He started explaining an idea that NASA has compelled to try to get us over to the planet without being harmed. Paragraph 5 it stated,'' Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles abover the roiling venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.'' In that statement he/he explained that it would risky but survivable for humans.

As i stated in the first paragraph above the author started

using conclusions of how we were going to use the technology and what other idea NASA may come up with incase one plan went left. In paragraph 6 it stated, ''we only have a limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.'' this is where the author starts using methods of how the mission will be preformed because of some road blocks we'll run into. Paragraph 7 it stated, ''NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions.''

The author has done a fantastic job wit backing up his idea with

details, facts, road blocks and the way the missons should go. He/He did an amazingly, confident article of how us humans could study venus, if one plan went left he/he stated other plans NASA and other scientis are coming up with in the studying of Venus. The details in this article would surely help scientist out with procedure of studying Venus. I think the author did a fantastic job with supporting his idea of studying Venus. ","
