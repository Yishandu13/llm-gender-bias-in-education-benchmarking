That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived.

This ssums up about everythung. His life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to his friend Don. He liked helping out. He couldnt work though because he had cracked ribs. After that he returned to being a seagoing cowboy. Then it made him more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need.               ","

M3,"Luke bomberger wants to become a seagoing cowboy. He really wants to become one. He crossed the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the pacific ocean twice to help people by World War 2. I got that off in the beginning of the story. In paragraph 4 it says that he had made nine trips-the most of any seagoing cowboy. In paragraph 5 it says luke also toured an excavted castle in crete. So far he is going good and he also became a seagoing cowboy and he is doing great. Helping out his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work nut not for dangers at sea. On luke's second trip luke served as night watchman. Luke had a little accident and he could not work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs but he was glad he made it out alive. Luke had wonderful time's and then bad one's but he always worked hard to become and seaboy cowboy and so far he is doing pretty bad right now because he broke his ribs. Luke also found time to have fun on board. Being a seagoing cowboy was being more than an adventure for luke. It opened up the world to him. Luke bomberger said ""I'm grateful for them opportunity"". He wanted to be a seagoing cowboy it was his dream it was all he has wanted to be and his dream came true he was the most wonderful seagoing cowboy he was hard working and he made it look fun. He worked hard for his dream and he has made it come true. He has done wonderful things.

At first he was working two part-time at the grocery store. That is were he was and used to be and that is were he was working. But now he has an even better life. So this was about Luke bomberger and his wonderful life and how he helped and how he used to be after he became a seagoing cowboy. What made luke love seagoing so much how did he get into it what made him love it so much what made him want that and not other things. I mean he started out at a grocery store the he land in begin a seagoing cowboym I guess he enjoyed that the most because he reallly done a lot of great things in his life he has gone done places he has basilly wanted to do. He has gone places he has wanted to go he has done things he has never done before. I mean if I was luke I would be so happy for myself and what I have done to have such great gift.

Now that his dreams came true in begin a seagoing cowboy. Well he has a good path on his way he still has a wonderful jorney to go on.

He has earned great stuff and he also deservet because out of his old life he has a whole life up a head no that he has got what he wanted he is going to try and keep it.

M5,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

He might have joined because he wanted to help other people because he might have wanted to help load the cattle and not hang out with his friends but if he were to travel to anouther place away from his friends he would be sad and so would I.I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl but we all have our own ideas. He wanted to change his life by doing good for otherr people and not just his self. Luke wants a experiance adventure with the seagoing cowboys but he cant do that if he dosnt have experance.

Luks parents wouldnt let him go if he didnt argue with them. You know why he wouldnt have arguied with his parents they might have sugested him going over to join the seagoing cowboys. That is why I think he should go.","

M9,"I think one reason to join is because he helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because he got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also he had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also he visited many unique places while he was on the trip as he did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how he felt being on the trip and telling them how he helped all of these peaople. Also he told us why he kept on going out and doing/helping anyone he could. Another way he claimed his reason's is by telling us how and what he did on his free time from wherehe was at. Also his emotion tells us how he claimed some parts of his reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's his reason's because one he used his emotion by saying how he felt when he was there. Second He said that he had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least he told us what he did on his free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.

M11,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.","

M15,"In the passage it states that he says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town boy. He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

M18,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

M19,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.","

M22,"He wanted to jion the program because it would be an opportunity of a life time for luke. He could travel the world see new things meet new people and make more friends when he goes to the program.

He wanted to jion the army service and help out so the told him to say in what he was doing and that he was on bored with the army. He helped take horses to greece on ship and that is hard to do with 335 horses on bored the ship,and he had to take care of them by feeding them,getting the poop up and out of there cage. When he was helping one night he almost fell off bored the ship and went into the dark Atlantic but lukly there was a melt bar that stopped he from falling off the edge of the ship.

When the horses got off the ship the men could play basketball,volleball,and table tennis with all the men on bored.

He started in 1945 with his friend from high school .When he left the army in 1947 he was glad to do all those things he had done to help all those people in need. He was als hapy that he got to travel to all the places he had always wanted to go to in the world to help people he didn't know that was in need that he got to know as a friend.

When he was done he went back home and did something new with his life again to see what he could learn about then.

My conclusion are that he was really happy for helping peopl in need. I think what made him the happy's was that he got to travel the world to help people. He went to China,Greece,and other cool place like that.","

M24,"Luke is telling people to join. He wants more people. Luke is convincing people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. He would see and adventure other places.

Another detail about Luke convincing people is to help him go to other places.

When he was going to graduate, soon his life would change. When it was 1945, they saw their seaman's paper. They headed to Greece. When luke turned 18. He could be draft to the military service. By the time he was dischared in 1947, Luke had made nine trips.

Another reason Luke would let you join is he would let u travel with him. It will be a good opportunity. He led international students and exchange visitors for many years. He said it might be difficult for him. It took him time to do everything. he had to check the animals for one hour. He was so tierd. On one night he was a night watchman. Luke had alot of bad days. He had to clean the ship. He was busy the whole time but he was ok because he had food to eat. it was fun for him.

Luke was a kind and brave person. He was really cool. I think he convinced a lot of people to join. It was really hard for him. He had to work and do stuff. He is a nice guy.","

M25,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy let Luke see all over the world and help people in need. He had the most fun on his home with the other Seagoing Cowboys. They would play Base baseball and volleyball in the empty hold of the animals been housed. They would aslo play table-tennis touranments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. When he turned 18 he wsa his way to Greece (as a Seagoing Cowboy) and he got draft. When they found out he was a Seagoing Cowboy they said he could do his service as a Seagoing Cowboy.

It opend up the world to him. He got to see the Acropolis in Greece and he rode up in Venic, Italy were the streets are water. Helping out on his Aunt's farm helped him for the hard work as a Seagoign Cowboy but it didn't help for the danger of the sea. It made him more awar of peole in other countries that need help and that stayed with him for life and he shared that wiht his family. He always said it was more than just an adventure.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun at times but can be realy hard at some parts. It helps for life like school does. I think that more peole sould get a try to become a Seagoing Cowboy just to learn soem of the same thing Luck did or see the things he might have seen. So give it a try it can be fun! ","

M27,"Luke is very courageous because he joined the World War II. He left his family to save other peoples lives. He is hardworking because he is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Even though he got hungry and tired he didn't quit. He discovered unique places in the world and meet other people.

Luke helped people that are in the war and people that does'nt have food, water, and shelter. He would want other men to join the war because it made him feel good about hiself because he repected his country. Luke didn't even think if he wants to be a a military he just said yes because he knew that it would be a oppurtunity of a lifetime.

I think that people should join war, so that we could have our freedom by getting it ourselves, by fighting in war and being courageous like Luke. Luke can inspire people and wanting themselves to join the military. Most military says that ""We die with honor"".    ","

M32,"In this essay I will be writing a detailed argrument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.","

M36,"Luke was going to China, because his friend asked him and he said he couldn't pass this up. In the text it says that Luke had no idea that his life would change once he graduated high school. He was working two part time jobs. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. the United Nations Relief and rehabiliation Administartion hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the Mule that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys. The cowboy, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead his family to host a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet his family was very proud of him. When he turned 18 I bet he was excited because he could be drafted for miltary service. Then when his board learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to just keep doing that for service.

The reason you should join the Military is because you could save a life. Several of lives. Also because we probably need more people because we could always use more people to protect us. Luke made nine trips after 1947.    ","

M39,"In the article Luke was asked by his freind don to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so when he said yes that would change his life. So then now he has been on nine trips since the first ever trip that he has taken. Luke was always busy tending the cattle during the day. He was having lots of fun even when he got knocked over the boat and broken his ribs. He was playing board games and everything like that to keep him busy while he was healing.

The reason of Luke going on trips across the oceans because he likes it and he was born to do it. Also his freind asked Luke to come with him to keep him company during the trips. Luke was waiting for some thing to drastically change his life and he to his wish off the drastic change. Luke would stop going with don if Luke didn't like the motion sickness,or because there where a lot of storms,or he didn't like tending the cows during the long and tiring journey. If the possibility was that Luke didn't like the sea his freind would be like are you ok and or something like that.

In conclusion Luke loves the sea and he wants to keep going out and adventuring the wild and the unknown. Luke couldn't say no because it was his freind don and he wanted to explore another island. Luke loves the same because he likes tending the cows and he likes his fellow crew mates that are with him on his journeys to the out and the open sea. Another reason that is because he wants to be in dangerous storms and worlpools. Luke want to take the risks in the dangerous sea.","

M40,"The author supported his ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". He explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe he did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. He didnt just focus on one thing he focused on it all and he put his paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how he restated the question that he had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs he learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that he explained both bad and good thing about venus. He sounded like he knew exactly what he was talking about and he knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

M41,"After I read the passage I think Luke really wanted to do something good for the world or in other words, help others in need. If Luke wanted to tell someone to join the Seagoing Cowboys then he would want to in include the feeling he felt after seeing how much better people started doing after they helped them. He would probibaly also include that when they were done transporting the animals they got to go sight seeing and he would tell the person he ws trying to convince to join the Seagoing Cowboys that he got to go to/see Europe and China, he got to see Acropolis in Greece, he also would say he got to take a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, with streets of water, and he also got to tour an excacated castle in Crete. I think Luke would have a great attitude and he would want more people to meet.

After the war he joined the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Luke was only 18 when all of this happened.

Alot of people died but not in his hands.

M44,"Shuold we join The UNRRA

In this passage a Cowboy who rode the waves Luke was a seagoing cowboy. Luke Bomberger is his full name. There are many reasons why Luke Bomberger join the program to participate in the seagoing Cowboys. Luke was a awesome seagoing cowboy.

My first reson i think Luke join the program was because he got to take trips to alot of countrys to help animals. Luke thought it was fun being a segoing cowboy. Luke also found time yo have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another reason he join the program, because he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Luke help other countrys with thier needs and to provide food.

My second reason why he wanted to be a seagoing cowboy is because he wanted to help countrys animals, and be a great man. Luke claims that the cattle boat trips were an unbelievalbe opportunity for a small-town boy"", he says. Besides helping people Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.

My third and final reason is he made about 16 times he crossed the Alantic ocean,and pacific ocean twice. Luke And Don both signed up for UNRRNA (the united nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration). Don is Luke friend that help him to get to be a seagoing cowboy. Don Resit is his name he invited Luke to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It took them some time to take tips.

Inconculsoin This was a Good passage, I think it kind of wanted me to be a seagoing cowboy but only if i was in back in the old day. Luke was a great

seagoing cowboy he had the most trips of any seagoing cowboy witch was nine trips.Luke liked to help animals he also liked to help people get thier food and he sometimes provides for them witch he does anyway. Luke was Maybe one of the top best people of being a seagoin cowboy.                                  ","

Luke Bomberger had two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. One day, his friend, Don Reist, invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. To help countries in need to get food supplies, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and they hired ""sea cowboys"" to help countries in need. It was 1945 and the end of World War II in Europe when Luke and Don signed up to become a sea cowboy.

In August 1945, Luke and Don received orders to get a boat in New Orleans. They boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece. On the way, Luke turned 18, which ment he could be drafted for military service. When the military found out that Luke was a sea cowboy, they decided to let him do that for service. Luke went many places such as Greece, Crete, Panama, and Italy. He spent the rest of his life at his home.

Sea cowboys get to go lots of places, according to the text above. Luke went to places such as Panama and Italy. Why don't you sign up to be a sea cowboy? Sea cowboys get to travel the seas and see different places. Sea cowboys help people. Sea cowboys travel. I don't see why you shouldn't become a sea cowboy.

Sea cowboys helped many people in the 1940's. Luke Bomberger traveled many places and helped many people. He is a legend among the sea cowboys. Sea cowboys got to see many places and different countries. Sea cowboys helped the military. Sea cowboys got to go down the Panama canal and ride on boats through the canals in Italy.

To help countries in need to get food supplies, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and they hired ""sea cowboys"" to help countries in need. It was 1945 and the end of World War II in Europe when Luke and Don signed up to become a sea cowboy.

In August 1945, Luke and Don received orders to get a boat in New Orleans. They boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece. On the way, Luke turned 18, which ment he could be drafted for military service. When the military found out that Luke was a sea cowboy, they decided to let him do that for service. Luke went many places such as Greece, Crete, Panama, and Italy. He spent the rest of his life at his home.

Sea cowboys get to go lots of places, according to the text above. Luke went to places such as Panama and Italy. Why don't you sign up to be a sea cowboy? Sea cowboys get to travel the seas and see different places. Sea cowboys help people. Sea cowboys travel. I don't see why you shouldn't become a sea cowboy.

Sea cowboys helped many people in the 1940's. Luke Bomberger traveled many places and helped many people. He is a legend among the sea cowboys. Sea cowboys got to see many places and different countries. Sea cowboys helped the military. Sea cowboys got to go down the Panama canal and ride on boats through the canals in Italy. You should become a sea cowboy too.      ]""

M56,"Luke wanted to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because he knew it would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When Luke went he would be helping horses, young cows, and mules being shipped over seas to a new locatation he had to help gather suplies, animals and many other things supplies to help out things that had gone wrong also 44 nations joined together to help them out.

In one of Luke's trips there had been more then 335 plus enough hay to feed all of them. By time Luke had turned 18 he had arrived in Greece which meant he could go into the military service. When Luke had been discharged he had maken more then nine trips, that is the most any Seagoing Cowboy has ever gone in this service. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the United States, and on top of it took them a month to get to China.

When Luke was younger he used to help out on his Aunt Katie's farm, this helped him to learn his hardworking skills but never trained him for the dangers at sea. He had decided that helping out in the Seagoing Cowboys and all of the animals, and food services was worth all the help that him and his pals had given. It was real rainy one night after making his hourly check up on the horses to report to the captain when he had slipped down a slippery ladder ship cracking some of his ribs so then he couldn't do his job for a couple of days.

Luke also had a lot of fun on board with all of his friends. When the animals had been unloaded they played baseball, volleyball, fencing, table tennis and a lot more sports and game. Luke said that being a Seagoing Cowboy was way much more then an adventure he had opened up the world for Luke. He was very grateful for his jouney, it mad him more aware of the other countries and there needs.

Luke had learned everything from helping out animals to teamwork. Luke thought seen that helping other countries is fun but you do have to learn teamwork and much more. When he had broken some of his ribs he had to stop working his job for a while. When he got back on the job he was feeling very happy for what he had just accomplished for the world. ","

M62,"When Luke was a little town boy he made a huge inprovment by becoming a

Seagoing Cowboy. He saw a lot of stuff on the boat as you can tell on paragraph 5 he said, ""Besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be a great experince for a small town boy. I think it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. If his friend had not been there to tell him about it he would have been working two jobs his whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.

Luke is also the best there because he has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what he saw during the trip and what he did. He loves to help people by this job he has helped bring all the cattle/food. Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. He worked so much he got hurt and craked his ribs. He was happy to be alive. Therefore he had to stay at home to get better.

Luke's point of view would also tell how fun it was to work there and he would convince you that it is a realy good job. He was very happy to get this job beause he said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Luke created history and when he could not do the job any more people visited him all the time like students and many familys to live on all the history he made. It opened up Lukes world up when he got the job. Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away. Its amazing how he can get all those animals and pick them up on the boat and take them across the country and drop them off. He was realy good at his job to do that!

M65,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! You should join it because you get to help others and animals. Also it not just a plus for them it is one for you too. The plus is that when you travel to help others you get to see the ocens all the time and beautiful sights! It is an opportunity of a lifetime if you ask me! If I was old enough I might what to think about being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Luke's claim was a great claim! Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank he became a Seagoing Cowboy! Even himself he said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' He helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. He recovered their food supplies. He went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have a responsibility to help animals and more! But it can also be dangerous crossing the oceans all the time. If you want to be a Seagoing cowboy you have to be brave and courageous! You need those traites because if that was your job you would'nt want to be nervous or afraid all the time.

Luke had too be brave he had to have a great outlook to kept doing what he was doing, And you can too! His point of veiw was strong. He went on 9 trips and that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! He also had a cargo of 355 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them! He even cracked his ribs, but he is ok. Over something small but he was brave enough to keep going because he cared for the animals and he loved his job.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys! He even know himself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.                                    ","

The purpose of the Seagoing Cowboys was to bring livestock and food for the livestock so they could live and eat so they wouldn't to stay without shelter.

food so they brought and the reason luke knew how to do all that hard work was because he helped out a bunch on his aunt's farm with cattle and horses and on Lukes second trip he was a watchman at night so no one would steal i would think.

Then later on that night he ended up breaking some ribs because he crashed into the metal strip on the side of the ship so he wouldnt fall in the ocean.

M71,"Have you ever read the story A Cowboy who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a boy who is invited to Europe and he becomes a Seagoing Cowboy after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowboy, the Seagoing Cowboy has to take care of animals on a ship and a boy named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowboy, a Seagoing Cowboy is a Cowboy who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowboy in the story was no different he took go care of the animals. Everyday he watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowboy he knew it was going to be alot of hard work so he worked as hard as he could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and he explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowboy I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowboy,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowboy is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to him. And in Luke's own words he said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowboy can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, he slipped on a ladder and cracked his ribs but thankfully he didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of his side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

Now you know how the Seagoing Cowboys worked, how they took care of animals and how Luke explored. Now, if you want to achieve something like Luke did then get out there and show everyone that you can do what you dream to do.","

M74,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was one of the best times of Luke's life. He got to travel the world and explore. And he got to help people around the world.

Paragraph 3 tells us about how in August 1945, Luke received orders to go to New Orleans. He arrived Agust 14, 1945. There Luke got my seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before he made it to Greece. This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a lot more than an advemture for Luke. In paragraph 9 he quotes, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""","

Don was going to Europe on a cattle boat to help people in ruins from World War II. so Luke thinks, this is a opportunity of a lifetime so he said yes to Don.

So they get on the boat where they are taking 335 horses plus their food. The whole crew takes turn caring for them. There are also nightwatch men who watch the animals through out the night. On one rainy night Luke was the watchman he went to tell the captain his hourly report. After he did he slid down a slippery ladder and landed on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small piece of metal stopped him from going overboard. He was happy to be alive but he could not work for a few days because he had cracked ribs.

He turned 18 on a trip to Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. When his draft board found out that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to keep doing trips. Lukes most fun times where on the way back from somewhere. Because they had dropped off all of the animals so they could play in the huge place where they had been.

And after all of the adventures he was happy that he had the opportunity to do that it really opened up the world to him.","

Right when they started to leave to europe world war 2 ended. They had arrived August 14 the day the pacific war ended.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. He was very scared when he almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved his life. Luke would find some time to have his own time and talked to the animals.","

M81,"Today we will be talking about the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.","

Luke probably liked helping with the animals,because He helped his grandmother with her farm. Luke helped horses,young cows,and mules. When that was over it opened his world and his heart. That was a big opportunity for a big act of kindness. He helped countries in their needs. Luke had a good time and a real good heart because he could have said no but he didn't.

Luke had a lot of fun in this ones in a lifetime adventure. Luke said that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable awesome. Luke traveled to Italy,China,and Europe. the most speical place he went was in Acropolis in Greece. The other trips were good but that was special. He injoyed the city with streets of water.

M84,"Would you like to travel like Luke had traveled to and by cities.Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more for Luke Bomberger.His deamnor had changed since he became a Seagoing Cowboy.He was like a kid in a candy store,for the first when he got to see all the different countries.Then the animals were happier than a dog being scrachted on the belly when they got food or water,thanks to Luke and the workers.But Luke can be gregarious around the animals since he was a nice guy.When ever he to a nice place he thought oh-my-gosh-that is-so-pretty.

Luke also had fun on board,especially on return trips after animals had been unloaded.In the empty holds where the animals would be.They would play games to pass time.When would play games that are inncouius it would just be to pass time.Some of the Seagoing Cowboys maybe

a little zealous at times.During the games people can be exited over fencing like a professinal.

On his trip,Luke served as a night watchman.So someone can keep watch over the deck of the ship,and below the deck of the ship.He does this so all the supplies and cargo doesn't get damaged or gets hurt.He likes being a Seagoing

Cowboy becauis he gets to travel ever where.Then see animals like he is use to helping out.","

M85,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and his friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowboy. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy. Luke showed that he wanted to help others and animals as he would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I think he liked China as the best tour that he probably been on before, because he talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that he had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowboy that was showed in the passage. And he loves that he is doing in the passage i think, he likes caring for other animals that were in the passage that it was stated in the passage.      ","

M86,"From Luke's experieance he know's that he is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever! We are very lucky to live in the USA becuase we have many more oppertunities the anyone else does.      ","

M95,"I think that Lukes point of viewIf you were going to ask someone to do it then you would it might change your life. In the article is that he his a little nervous that he will be going on a ship for a long time. And he wanted to got out on sea and see what it was like.

He said that it will not be good that if he gets injured then you will have to stop working and that is bad! He said that it was a little bit bad when you hurt your self and you can't work anymore.

He said in the passage that he said that he was thankful that the metal rail saved him from going overboard. He said that was in the text was that there was more things to do like playing baseball. soccer. volleyball,and those other sports too. That is what i think that the point of view for luke is.","

M97,"Luke bomberger had an interesting story to tell about his adventures on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than ""Best job ever."" ","

M99,"Luke was a sea cowboy he described every thing wonderful and great but is he just saying that to bring more people in the business .

My first reason that shows that Luke is maybe trying to bring more people to work with him is that in the whole script he only comes across one problem but everything else is great which is hard to believe because in the sea there could be storms ,waves,floods or leaks on the boat but surprisingly he never comes across any of those problems which is odd.

My second reason that shows that Luke is just trying to bring people into the business is in the text it said that Luke kept on saying that he got to ride gondola in the streets of water in Spain,and got to excavate a castle in create , and even got to see the Panama Canal on his way to China so he is basically saying that all of the things he did where fun he got to go siht seeing but not everything he did could of been fun he also had to feed animals and clean stables so not every thing he did was fun.

In conclusion these reasons show Luke maybe is liens but maybe he is telling the truth its up to you to choose a side is he lying or not so maybe just maybe he could be telling the truth.","

M103,Well in the Seagoing Cowboys program i think people and plus they get to travel on a boat. Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time boy just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger he said he is grateful for this opportunity. It made him be more aware of people. He hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell him about his job.,"

M104,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help. Thats why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke was brave enough to do this kind of thing just because of 1 thing, he had faith in him, his best friend, and the people. Im pretty sure your going to have a warm welcoming home surprise waiting for you at your place. Im entirely sure that all of you want that surprise. Just join the Seagoing Cowboys program and your garenteed and fun active time with the people you are working with and the peoeple that need your help. So have the faith Luke had, and come on down and sign up for Seagoing Cowboys program. Hope to see you there cowboy.

Oh and one more thing, have some faith in yourself, it always turns out good. Just ask Luke Bomberger, he will tell you about all that happen just with a lot of faith and courage.","

M105,"It could be a opportunity of a lifetime to travel over sea's and be a Seagoing cowboy. It can lead your family to host a number of international student to help educate them in learning like school for them. You can help people with their needs and other countries that suffer without food or water. Being a Seagoing cowboy can lead to many different adventures in life.

Luke said for being a Seagoing Cowboy he lead his family to host lots of international students and exchange visitors for many years. He overthought about going too but he just couldn't just skip this opportunity of a lifetime. He also didn't know his life would change really quick right after high school graduation. World War II was over in Europe and many countries were left in pieces.

Luke was very suprised about going over sea's.

It took him about two weeks for him to cross the Alantic ocean. It also took him a month to get to China because he was so far away from China. He has helped out his Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Which had made him brave enough to cross the oceans just him and some other people on board of the ship or boat.

That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did he fell and sliped up he ended up being fine.","

M106,"Luke is trying to convice people to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program by saying cool things that he does. For example: he is saying that he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. He also said that he finds time to have fun on board. some games they played were baseball, vollyball, Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Luke got to vist different places and he got to go to 16 different places. Luke also got to go to the Atlantic Ocean. Luke also liked to see the animals. He would always go visit the animals and feed them. Another thing luke would do is help people that got hurt during the War.

So those are a lot of fun things that luke did. He also did a lot of good things. Like feed animals, take them from one place to another, and help people that got hurt in the War. Luke shared all those fun and good things that he did to convice others to participate the Seagoing Cowboys program.

M108,"A good reason to join the program was that the cattle-boat trips were an unbielievable opportunity for a small town boy. It was because besides helping people you get to see lots of stuff while in the process of doing these things like Europe and China.

Luke turned 18, he was old enough to be drafted into the military when Luke draft board learned that he was on cattle-boat trip, they told him to just keep doing that for his service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips and that was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke got to explore the world, also found time to have fun aboard after they got all the animals out, they played stuff like Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and those games helped pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him because he says that he's grateful for the opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

As he speaks he says it made him more aware of people of other countries and their expectations. That awareness stayed with him,leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.   ","

M110,"Luke was at his part time job when his friend Don came in and said (do you want to come on a cattle boat trip with me.) Luke knew it was a opportunity of a life time and couldn't say no. Luke was 18 before he arived in Greece which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When the draft board learned he was on a cattle baot trip they said that he was able to keep going on the cattle boat trip. The cattle boat trip was an unbeleivable opportunity for a small towns boy like hime.

Luke helped out on his aunt Katie's farm whch prepared him for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. Luke also found a way to have fun on board even on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

When Luke got home he was very grateful that he was able to go on the trip. To the cowboys it was an adventure but to Luke it was a opportunity to open up a whole new world. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host of intternational students and exchange visitors for many years.","

M111,"The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies,animals and more.

They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on his second trip luke served as a watchman.

His job was to check on all of the animals every hour.

One time he said he slipped and fell on his backside and his heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,thankfully a sharp peice of metal stopped his slide,or he would have flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive,but he could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board,especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded,the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

In conclusion, he feels that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure. Luke quotes,""I'm grateful for the oppurtunity,""he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

M113,"The author's points seem to come to one conclusion, and that is that we should explore Venus despite the risks. He supports this idea with many different examples and reasons.

One example of him supporting his idea is in paragraph 6. He says that the only way scientist can understand Venus is by taking a risk and to think of it as a challenge. This supports his claim because hes saying to take a risk and explore Venus, despite the obstacles. Another thing he seems to push alot as a reason we should explore Venus is that we just don't have alot of knowledge about it. An example of this is in paragraph 2, when he said not a single space space craft has landed on venus in over three decades.

Another way he supports his idea is in paragraph 8. He says that striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value. This really supports his idea because he's saying that exploring Venus is worth something. He also says space exploration shouldn't be limited by dangers and doubt, which would imply that he supports exploring Venus.

The author supports his idea that we should explore Venus more despite the risks well with many different reasons. Like how we have almost no knowledge about it. Or how we should take the risks as challenges and try to overcome them. In the end he supports his idea well and backs it up with valid claims.            ","

M114,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke joins the Seagoing Cowboy program.

In this story it talks about what Luke does on his journey so, this is what were are going to talk about.

In paragraph 1 it says Luke's friend Don Reist invited Luke to go with him to the Seagoing Cowboy program and Luke did not turn the offer down because that was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In paragraph 4 it said that

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment he could be drafted for military service.

""When my drafy board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

In paragraph 5 there were some reasons he should join the Seagoing Cowboys, and it said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says.

""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""

he says. ""So was taking a Gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

In paragraph 7 the way Luke's claim supported the outcome of the story.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he could not work for a couple days because of cracked ribs.

My conclusion of the story is in paragraph 9 when it says, But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.","

Luke says he gets to care for the animals while he´s crossing oceans. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalles had to be cleand too.

M117,"Luke really enjoyed the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping people or takeing care of things thin this is the job for you. The Seagoing Cowboys helped take care of cows,hores, and mules that where over seas. Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece, that ment he could sing up for miliary service. He was on his cattle-boat trip when he signe u for the miliary. They had plenty of food and water to feed the anmials and themselves.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel a lot of places. Luck had been on 19 trips before they discharged him in 1947. If you like traveling then this is for you. They went all the way to China and it took them one whole month. They went to a lot of different places. Luck though all of his trips where very special.

Luck had come a long way since he was a kid. Luck grew up in in the country. He helped his aunt Katie out on the farm. He didn't have the best life when he was a kid. When Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy it opened up the world for him.

When Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy it was much more than an advernture even though he did travel a lot. Luke was very greatful for the opportunity. Luke saw that other countries don't have a lot of stuff like we do. He saw that they where in need. That awareness stayed with him almost his whole life.

Luke didn't just work he had a lot of fun on board. They played a lot of games like fencing, boxing, table-tennis tournaments, games, reading, and whittling made the time go by pretty quick. It was a lot easier to play the games when the animals where unloaded.

He sometimes went to places where war had just ended to help them in need. They also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty spaces where the animals usest to be.

Luke was a very kind harted person. He never though about just himself. He would go back and do it all over again. Luke was a very thoughful person. Tell me would you ever be a Seagoing Cowboy.         ","

Luke didn't just work he had a lot of fun on board. They played a lot of games like fencing, boxing, table-tennis tournaments, games, reading, and whittling made the time go by pretty quick. It was a lot easier to play the games when the animals where unloaded.

He sometimes went to places where war had just ended to help them in need. They also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty spaces where the animals usest to be.

Luke was a very kind harted person. He never though about just himself. He would go back and do it all over again. Luke was a very thoughful person. Tell me would you ever be a Seagoing Cowboy.         ]""

You get to see new and diffrent things when your in it.

You also get to go on a long ship/ boat ride.

If i were a boy i'd love to do the seagoing cowboy's program.

You may not but we all have our own opinion's.

What he did was very nice, and put himself in a great spot in life.

He didn't only help himself he helped others.

Luke sounds happy and that's what most people want at least that's what i want, so if you like seeing new and bueatiful things you'll want to do this.

Luke didn't really have a choice. He had no idea that his life would change when he graduatated from high school.

He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no, he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke is intersting he didn't want his life to go where it was going but if you do the right and great things. The right and great things will come back to you.

And that is what happened to Luke he was doing the right thing and one or two will or did come right back.

They did have to fight for there country but it wasn't just there's it was for others also.

This was a very imformational artice about if you do the right thing it comes right back, and if you can also in this article it did.","

M121,"The Seagoing Cowboys was part of a program called the UNRRA that helped rebuild cities after World War 11. The Cowboys transported animals such as, horses, young cows, and mules overseas to the ruined cities. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke became a Seagoing Coyboy after his high school graduation. The reason he joined was because his freind Don invited him to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke didn't disagree because he knew it would be a opportunity of a lifetime.

If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be a part of a very important program. 44 nations united to help the contries in ruins after World War 11. The Seagoing Cowboys shipped the animals to help the countries regain their food supplies, animals and other things that the countries needed.

Being one of the Cowboys didn't mean it was all work and no play. During the trips across the oceans you can see China, Greece, and other contries you've probaly never seen before. After a hard days work of cleannig stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table-tennis also kept the Cowboys ocupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on his second trip. His job was to check on the animals every hour. After he made his report to the captian he slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall twards the Atlantic. A piece of metal stopped his fall but he couldn't work because he cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowboys you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of suprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others.","

M123,"Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,""he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. In 1945 world war 2 made places get ruined so he decied to go to Seagoing Cowboys. He help animals like horses,young cows,and mules too.

M125,"So when Luke came back to China he saw even more homeless people than before. So he thought he would have to make a change to that.

So when he was setting up a program for conviencing people to help the homeless Don tried to call and have him come to America and and Luke said, ""Don, I can't I have to help the people in China because I see little kids and grown people starving on the street and that hurts me."" So then when he had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help.

M127,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The cattle-boat trips are an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But when Luke went to see the Acropoils in Greece he said it was specail. He also said that gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Luke also found fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys would have so much fun the would play baseball and volleyball in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you can have a lot of fun there its fun, helpful to people, entertainig you if you are bored and its cool and it has a lot of space. You can save people and animals. You can save the person if they are drowning by your boat or you can save an animals if they fall of your boat.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. Luke said it opended up the world to him he said he is grateful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. That aware stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain, he slide down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

In conclusion, I truly think that in this passage he was trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program and Ithink that you should believe that to. I gave you my evidence and my reasoning why I think this and if you read my evidence you should to.","

M136,"Luck Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Don Reist his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

He said yes right then he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke signed up with his friend Don.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When his draft board learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to keep doing that for his service.

By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to him.

He is grateful for the opportunity.

It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.      ","

M137,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rides the Waves"" a young adult named Luke signs up for a program that is called the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" that take care of horses, young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys do this because countries that were destroyed need them for travel and food. Now here are three reasons why Luke decided to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Luke signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys because it was an opportunity of a life time. That means that he would not get anymore chances to travel on a boat around the world. This is also a big opportunity mostly because he is a farm boy from a small town. In paragraph 5 and 1 it states ""... Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy, but besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China..."" Also Luke wanted to join because he got to help countries that were damaged from the war. In the two sentences that were right before the first paragraph (the ones that help explain the story a little bit) it states "" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II (or WWII for short).""

The last reason that Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys was because he got to be with animals. In paragraph 7 it states "" Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm had prepared Luke for the hard work..."" So that means that if he worked on a farm with a lot of animals, and he joins something with animals, that means he likes animals. Also in paragraph 1 it states "" ... Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat."" So that would mean that he wants to travel with animals in a baot or he wants to be in a boat filled with animals because he like animals (this story is kind of reminding me about Noah's Arch, you know the one with the boat filled with animals because there was a giant flood).

So those are the reasons why Luke desided to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Remember he joined because he wanted to help countries that were damaged or destroyed in the World War II, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for him because he is a farm boy, and because he got to be with animals. That is why Luke joined the program.","

M139,"Luke was 18 years old. He just finished his high school graduation. Luke had two jobs working at a grocery store and at a bank, until his life cahnged.

Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. World War II just ended and a lot of countries needed help, so Luke and his friend started to help. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of all of the animals that would be on the boat. Luke and Don then signed up.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Luke was happy that he was helping people but he was also really excited to see Europe and China. Luke also went to Venice, Italy and he even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy really helped and prepared him for this hard work that he is doing today. Then soon enough, Luke got a new job on the boat. Luke's job was check on all the animals every hour.

Then one night Luke's life almost ended. Luke was going to go see the captain but he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke almost flew overboard but a metal along the edge stopped him.

Luke had fun on board also. The cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

Luke was happy for what he has done. It made Luke more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness always stayed with him. Luke saved peoples lives. Luke is a hero.","

Well if that did'ent convinc you than, hears something that might, Luke Bomberger him self said ""He found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had beeen unloaded.""The Cowboys also played baseballand volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."" Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. When Luke and his friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of him self becaus he helped out his aunt Katie on her farm as a boy , but his chalang was the dangerous seas.

Now Luke was in his early 20s and he was on his second night of wachman job, that ment that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night ,he was making his hourly report to the captin. on his way down he sliped down aladder on his back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stoped him from falling into the dark, cold,tarorizing Atlantic.

He had crackend a couple of his ribs. In Lukes life time Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Being Sea going Cowboy is much more Than a great time its an opportunity for you it giving you achance to see the word, and it shows you how much we are given in are country than other people around the world.

That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Bomberger. After you do this you can tell stundents and others about what you did to help others ,and you might even make an impact on others. For being in his 20ntys Luke was a smart young man for what he did.

So what chose are you going to make during your life , help ,or let animals die and people that need the food to servive and let them die to die?

Whats your chose?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ","

M150,"I think you should join and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping others this would be a good thing for you to do. Why would u want to go? You would probably want to join because you get to help people affected by the World War II. You also ge to help out animals like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Who doesn't like that?

Many countries were left to ruins in Europe, so to help them the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of things. It was a big opportunity! One of the Seagoing Cowboys, Luke, said that he liked helping the animals on the ship. He loved taking care of the horses and young cows they had. He mentioned that he also enjoyed taking care of the people in need, it made him feel good! He also said he is really grateful he got to have the Oppurtunity of his lifetime!

If u would like to do any of these things I mentioned in this paragraph then being in the Seagoing Cowboys program would be perfect for you. But these are only a few reasons why you could or wanted to join.","

M152,"Luke Bomberger had a friend who asked him to tour Europe with him, he knew he couldn't turn it down.

World War II had just been in Europe, but was now over. Many comturies were left in ruins. These contries needed animals and livestock to survive. The UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the livestock on the boats when they were being shipped to a certain part of the world to another. Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

When Luke had quit the seagoing cowboys, he had successfully completed nine trips, the most trips a seagoing cowboy has ever done, delivering animals to people in need of them.","

M153,"In this article the author tells us about Venus. He tells us that it is called the ¨Evening Star¨, that it is known as Earths ¨twin¨, and then he explains the attempts made to study and learn more about the planet. He also explains how those attempts were unsucsessful and that the planet is dangerous. But, despite the dangers he has presented to us, he explains that it is worth the danger. I dont personaly believe he did the best job explaining why he believed so and he definitly did not convince me to think the same.

The author never truely explained his claim that he thought exploring Venus was worth the risks and complications. For most of the artical he rambles on telling us about and explaining what was already found out about the planet. He never gave reasoning for believing we sould follow threw with trying to learn more about the planet. He only breifly told us his claim in the last paragraph, paragraph 8. It reads, ¨Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.¨ He tells us that all we will get from risking our lifes is insite on a dangerous planet that we may not even have use for, and he states that we will be faced with more and or equally intimidating endeavors. It may just be my opinion but that does not seem like very convincing or valid reasons for putting lifes in danger.

I truely believe that the author of the artical, ¨The challenge of Exploring Venus¨ did not support his claim and what he believed very well let alone at all. All he gives us is two reasons that are not very valid and did not back them up or tell us why those reasons make a good point and sould make us think the same way. He did not tell us why we needed the information so badly that we should risk our lifes or even make the effort. I do not belive the author supported the idea or really stated his claim or what he belived. He needs more reasoning and explaining of what we would gain from this and how it would benifit us. He also would need more supporting details of what we need the information for and why.","

Second why they chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that it is a bone breaking job.So they joined this program becuse they could help the contries that were left in the ruins. This is one reason why people shold perticapate in the UNRRA, And people should join the UNRRA becuase People could help the earth be a better place by giving the people food, or milk a dairy cow.

last why he chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that he is strong I think luke's claim is that this is not an easy task Becuse you will get hurt. The text states"" a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlanic"" This shows that you might be left with a few broken bones, Just a few right?

This shows that this job can be a bone breaking expience. Now you know what a seagoing cowboy is a hardworking, bone breaking, strong kind of a man.    ","

The text states"" a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlanic"" This shows that you might be left with a few broken bones, Just a few right?

This shows that this job can be a bone breaking expience. Now you know what a seagoing cowboy is a hardworking, bone breaking, strong kind of a man.    ]""

M155,"Luke Bomberger had no idea how his life would change after gradutating high school. After graduating high school Luke Bombergers friend asked his if he wanted to go on a cattle boat. The reason they had the cattle boats was because World War II had just ended in Europe. After World War II ended many countries were crumbling. They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.

A reason Luke Bomberger joined the cattle boat knew it would be fun. Another reason Luke Bomberger joind the Europe on a cattle boat trip was because he said ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August, 1945. It took about 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean.

While Luke was on a trip to Greece he had his 18th birthday, Luke could've gone to the military, but his draft board told him to stay. By the time Luke was dicharged he had been on 9 cattle boat trips, that is the most of a sea going cowboy. ","

M157,"Luke was had just graduated High School and had 2 part time jobs. One day Don, Luke's friend came to ask Luke if he wanted to travel on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. Luke had said yes and at that moment he had just began an amazing adventure.

Luke had a very good experience that might have inspired the reader to do the same things. Luke was not only traveling in a boat to Europe but, he was also helping people get back to good shape because, world war 2 had just ended leaving them in bad shape. Students should be inspired because, Luke was helping people get back in good shape. People might also convinced to do the same thing Luke did.

Luke was having a lot of fun traveling around the world on a cattle ship. Luke knew this was an amazing opportunity in his life. Lukke himself had said that this was an amazing opportunity for a small town boy. He saw so many amazing things in the places he went. Luke had mentioned that he had been to Europe, China and Greece.

As Luke was on that cattle ship, he was helping people around the world get back to good shape, he was helping society. He was also bonding with animals, he was taking good care of animals. Most importantly it seemed like Luke was learning about the world and animals on this experience. Luke was experiencing how hard work felt. Luke, was really busy as they were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He had to care of the animals by, feeding them, also giving them water and cleaning their stalls.

On his 2nd trip though he did have a diffcult time because, on a rainy night Luke was put as a watchman. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour. He had slipped down the ladder and got hurt. Because he couldn't work for a while, Luke found some ways to have fun on the ship. He and his friends played baseball and volleyball where the animals had stayed. After Luke had been discharged in 1947, Luke had made 9 trips(the most out of all seagoing cowboys!)

Luke knew from the very beginning that this travel was the very beginning of an amazing adventure. Luke had learned alot over his travel. He had been to so many amazing places.He had been part of an amazing adventure to help people, that might have inspired\convinced to do the same thing.","

M159,"Luke Bomberger used to be an average teenager working two part-time jobs. Then his friend, Don Reist, came and asked him if he wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.

The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.

The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.        ","

M160,"The author claims that studying Venus is worthy despite the many dangers. Throught the whole passage the author gives pros and cons about exploring Venus. He mentions facts that are good and bad about the planet, and trys to convince the reader that this idea to explore the planet, despite its dangers, is good.

In the first paragraph the author is trying to pull the readers attention in. He gives examples about Venus and explaines why he thinks it is worth being explored. The author states little facts about the planet, but is careful not to mention its dangerouse factors yet. He simple states that another name for Venus is the evening star. He also goes on to say that Venus is the second planet to the sun, and continues with these simpe facts.

As the author moves on through the story he starts to explain more of the cons of exploring this planet. He says that the temperature is well over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit and aslo that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we epxerience on Earth.

By telling the reader this information he is proving that even though he is listing all the dangers of doing this and exploring the planet, that he is going to convince you that this is worth exploring. The author goes on to say how powerful this planet is by saying that we have sent space crafts to Venus before and it hasen't lasted more than a couple of minutes, so why would we bother sending a human. He then explains what technolgy that we would be using to make this happen. He says that the computers we have now coulden't work because they are to delicate and can break easily. However we have very old computers avalible to us. The computers that helped us in World War two in the 1940s. He goes on to explain how his would work. At the end he says how he knows that this will be hard but that our travel on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but that we should explore these dangers.

I feel that the author did a very nice job. He stated what the problem was. He then continued to go on and explain the pros and cons of both sides. He gave many facts that suported his statment in the begining. He also was very organized with his thoughts and how he organized his writting.","

M162,"After Luke Bomberger graduation, he had two jobs he worked ar a grocery store and a bank. so when his friend ask him to go to europe on a cattle boat. in the passage luke said that he could not say no. It also includes that it was an opportuity of a lifetime.

In the passage i said that unrra hired ""Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his aunt farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals.

I think that Luke and Don had a good reason to join that program.

Why i think that because they get to see alot of different things they never seen before. Also in the passage is states that Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been uploaded. He said being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. He says "" i'm gratefull for the opportunity.""","

In the passage i said that unrra hired ""Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his aunt farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals.

I think that Luke and Don had a good reason to join that program.

Why i think that because they get to see alot of different things they never seen before. Also in the passage is states that Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been uploaded. He said being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. He says "" i'm gratefull for the opportunity.""]""

M165,"An argument that I have about Luke's point of view about the Seagoing Cowboys program is when the artical said, "" By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy,"" and "" It toook two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China"". Who would ever want to take that long overseas.

Then, he also said,"" Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be cleaned"". I wouldn't want to work that hard overseas either.

Finally my last argument is when he said, "" On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. Who would ever want to go through that and get broken ribs. That is my argument to not be a Seagoing Cowboy.    ","

M166,"In this article, Luke enjoys being a Seagoing Cowboy and views it in a positive way. This was a great opportunity for him. He was able to help people during World War II. But as said in paragraph 9, he didn't only become a cowboy just to help people, like said in this quote from paragraph 9, ""It opened up the world to him."" This was was many of his reasons to join this program.

Although Luke had broken his ribs in paragraph 7, Luke continued to go on his adventure and still found ways to have fun like said in paragraph 8. This can prove that Luke enjoys what he is doing and that he loves being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In this whole story, it talks about someone named Luke Bomberger decided to join the Seagoing Cowboy program. It shows his experiences and what he learns from it, and the ongoing adventure he has throughout his life. So, helping people and exploring the seas is a great adventure and can teach many life experiences. There may be dangerous sea animals, such as sharks, but don't get discouraged, this can teach to go through many hardships that you may face and be able survive and be an opportunity for your life and your family.

If you like learning, then being a Seagoing Cowboy/Cowgirl can be an experience that will change your life like said in ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" If you don't like being what I said in this Draft, atleast reconsider your choice and think about the opportunity said in the Article. I understand, it will be really dangerous and risky, but if you manage to survive, you can learn many lessons and important life things not many people know.","

M170,"The Seagoing Cowboys, which included Luke Bomberger, had helped many people due to the effect of the Word War II. The Cowboys were known to help others, beat records from past Seagoing Cowboys, and meeting new people.

The Cowboys were a huge help after Word War II. They joined with 43 other nations to form UNRRA (The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administratation), which was to help countries recover animals, food suplies, and more. The UNRRA also hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas.

When joining any club or, for example, the ""Seagoing Cowboys"", records are to be broken. When Luke was 18, he had made nine trips, which was the most any Cowboy has made. This was a big acomplishment for him, because it showed everybody what he could do.

Entering a club is a chance to meet new people. For example, when all the animals were unloaded, it was time to bring out your game side. Luke and the cowboys would play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a wonderful experience, because you have the oppertunity to see new places, help others in need, and of course meet new people. The cowboys are more than just Seagoing Cowboys, their people helping people.                        ","

M171,"Exploration is key to a humans curiosity.Many people will indeed be anxious to explore something that is said to be impossible or dangerous because of curiosity.""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a prime example. In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.

One reason why the author of this article supports his ideas well is because he used statistics or in other words he used pathos.In paragraph five, he said""...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""He mentioned the idea of NASA creating a ""blimp-like"" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then he went on and entered his counterclaim by saying""...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,""therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.

Secondly,he states some facts about Venus itself.He added that ""...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also he siad that""...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.

Last but not least,in his conclusion he built a strong conclusion by mentionding in his opinion that""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation."" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.

In conclusion, the author supported his ideas well in the article. He supported his idead with statistics from NASA theirselves and he gave facts about Venus. He also included his counterclaims. Over all he gave a well informend and structures article.   ","

M178,"Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowboys effected his life and how he saw things. He got to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and it impacted his life forever. Other people who want to help the world should definitely participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason why other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because they would get to help recover other countries from the war.

The text states, by the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Finally, others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will change their lives. The text states, after his great adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke's family was lead to host a number of international students for many years. The text also states, this experience opened up the world to Luke. Luke also got to bond with new people on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He got to spend lots of time with them including times of playing volleyball, baseball, fencing, and many more activities to help pass time.

This shows why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. They would get to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and impact thier lives forever.      ","

M179,"In this passage you have heard about the Seagoing Cowboys and what they are and what they do. If you had to choose what would you choose do you think that is was right for Luke to convince others to participate in th Seagoing Cowboys program.

First, for some people some might think that Luke can convince other to join and I am on their side because if he is't able to convince people that how was he able to convince his friend to go with him. He could have just gone by himself and been selfish but he didn't want to be alone and wanted to be nice to his friend and asked him to come because he new that would have beeen the right thing to do. Luke was just trying be kind and nice ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke and his friend Don new that after all that time they didn't have to work two part jobs.

On the other hand, some might think that he shouldn't have to convince others to do that if he has to convince them than they really don't want to go. To some it might not have been a lifetime dream for some people or it might not have been a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are different and some are selfish so some might have thought that he really wasn't serious. So for some people they don't think that she should convince peopele to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

To wrap this all up, what I think Luke's point of view on convincing others to participate in thye Seagoing

Cowboys program that he should convince other so go and help because it is the right thing to do. Some think that he shouldn't convince people to go. But at the end of the day everybody is different and everybody think differently so what every you think it is up to you.,","

M180,"I think that this new technology can be valuable in many different ways. It can help teachers know why a student is acting different. It can also help teachers know why the kid is not turning in his homework. If the kid is getting in to trouble fighting in school teachers can use this to know why he is doing this to see wat is wrong or how he feels.

If a student is acting different in class teachers can use this new technology to identify his emotions and see why he is acting different. That way teachers can know why and maybe have a little talk with him. So that he stops acting the way he is n stop being disrespetful.

This new technology can also help the teachers know why this kid is not turning in his work. He may not turn in his work because he is sad or is not feeling good if teachers know this then they can talk to the kid and help him start turning his work in so that he can pass his classes and graduate.

If a student is getting into trouble, fighting , talking bad to teachers. The principles can use this knew technology to know why he is doing this or how he is felling maybe there is stuff going on at home and he is felling sad and angry at the same time. If teachers know then they can help this kid out and start to meke the kid make good choices.

Well this is why i think the use of this technology is valuable. hoefully we will have this someday i think that it will be really helpful and usefull for teachers i think they will use it a lot to find out how students are feeling or their emotions.                                           ","

M182,"The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn't quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great. Because it might be hard work but the animals need all the help they can get.","

M184,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that studying the planet Venus would be a rewarding endeavor. The author presents his claim and supports it very well through the knowledge he already has about the planet, the knowledge that the exploration of Venus might uncover, and persuasion through relating to his readers. This allows for the author to very clearly and precisely get his point across to those who might read the article. It also creates a strong way for the author to connect to his readers.

When the author uses the knowledge that he already has about Venus, he is trying to convey that what information we have on Venus is already important. In Paragraph 4, the author presents the idea that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". When the author introduces this concept, he also describes the surface of Venus to be ""rocky"" and ""includes similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"". Becuase the author presents the idea that Venus might have been like Earth and then goes on to describe this, he strongly supports his claim of how rewarding studying Venus could be. He is also trying to spark an interest in his readers regarding the study of Venus.

In Paragraph 6, the author suggests that researchers need to get closer to the ground.

When he says ""researchers cannot take samples...from a distance"", he is urging scientists to find ways to get closer to Venus's surface. To support this he also presents that scientists ""cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else"" without getting closer. He uses the curiousity of man to lure them into what he wants them to. This proves to be strong support for his main claim. This also leads right into the persuasion aspect of his support.

The author uses persuasion throughout the article, but in Paragraph 8 it is used excessively. Near the end of the paragraph, he introduces the idea that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". When he uses ""should not"" in that sentence, he is adding a strong opinion to his conclusion. In doing so, his opinion also contributes to the persuasion factor. This allows for him to call out to the reader individually and emotionally affect them. Using persuasion made way for the author to support his claim very well and influence the reader to think the same way as him.

Overall, the author has a very well thought-out way of supporting his claim that studying Venus would be a worthy persuit, despite the dangers. The author hits the brick wall head on by first presenting the knowledge he already has. This allows for the readers to have a little bit of foreground to play on. Then, he introduces the knowledge that could be gained by studying the planet, giving the readers a clear-cut example of how studying Venus might present important information. Finally, he includes persuasion, making it possible to influence the readers one by one. In conclusion, the author supports the claim, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents, very well.","

M186,"i think the author did a very good job on explanning his oppion, after reading The Chellenge of Exploring Venus. The reason why I think this is because he did so much reasearch on Venus. He told me how it is the most similuar planet to earth and the closer one to us to. He let me now that it is a very hot planet and could potentially be a hot planet, But by telling me all this it made me want to ask a question weather we could eventually expand humanity to a different planet. Sure enough he answered that questions for me. Its like he ws answering my question before i got to. He made it sound like we deffently need to explore Venus but one of the causes is that he said was safety, they havent sent another space craft down there because they wouldnt come back maybe later on in the future they might but as in right now they send little things up tthere. by reading this he made me think that venus would be woth exploring. Based on all this imformation this is why i thought that he explained his claim very well.","

M187,"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it's a fun and exciting program.

The text states,""The cattle-boat trips were and unbelievable opportunity for a benefiy of seeing Europe and China.""

The text also states,""But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says.

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Another reason to join the program is you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff.

The text states,""Luke served as a night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The text also states,""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

One final reason to join the program is because if you like dangerous stuff the program is dangerous.

The text states,""Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of craked ribs.""

Those reasons are why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.  ","

M192,"Luke said he grew up on an farm with his aunt so he wanted to help the animals. After World War 2 Luke wanted to help the countries recover by bringing food supplies and animals. Luke loved animals because when he was younger he had lived on a farm. So when he heard UNRRA is hirring Seagoing Cowboys to take care of Horses,Cows,and Mules he and his friend Don signed up. This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""he says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or girl. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people. Then again you should always help people. Luke went would you?                 ","

M195,"Peaple should join this program because you will learn about what the passage is about and write what you think its about. So,Luke was a cowboy that rode over seas. He rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. He started ride the seas in August,1945. When he was heading for greece he was 18 years old.

So,I think he rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old he was turning. But it wasn't that he wanted to ride the seas he rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous he gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so he told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible he made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took him to cross and eighteen times he crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowboy was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

Other peaple will have different opinions like adventures are better than being a seagoing cowboy,hating doing both,or not noing what a seagoin cowboy or a adventures does.","

M196,"I don't think I should be working with a bunch of cracked ribs guys. Oh shut up you are just tring to get out of work,said Jon. Luke spoke back saying,no I Iike this job. Theres no way you actilly like this job,theres just no way. As this arguement went on Rob was silantly siting there,not getting involved but then Luke asked him for backup. Luke is right, how would you feel Jon if someone was yelling at you for getting hurt,said Rob. Shut up,Rob don't you agree with me that it is not fair. Not fair? The mans ribs are shatered.

Shatered? His ribs were touched. Luke yelled at him if he wanted his ribs touched by him. Then Jon backed out scard but he did'ent give up. The reason Jon is doing it is because he thinks that Luke purpesly broke his ribs. You see Jon did'ent have a choice to come here because he was forced by his mom. His mom sent him because he would not move out of there house and she wanted him gone.

Jon dicided that he would go talk to the captin about it. The weird thing though is he did'ent tell them that are else they would come too. So he went to the captin telling him lies. The captin got really upset and went to talk to Luke. The captin was very angry now and he was just about to push Luke over bored but he did'ent because he would go to jail. When he reached Luke he yelled at him. Luke asked why. Wy are you yelling at me captin? You know exacily why I am yelling at you Luke. No I really don't.

I am yelling at you because you purpusely broke your ribs. Where did you get that from captin. Jon told me that he herd you say that to yourself. Look Jon told you lies because even if I did do that I don't talk to myself. You don't, yelled the captin. No,said Luke. Great now I have to talk to Jon. Im comeing too,said Luke. So they went to talk to Jon. They found him in the lounge. They walked up to him and started to talk.

The captin told him that he had giving false infomation. Jon talked back and said he is lieing and he really did do it on purpose. The captin ignored it. So Jon told them his story. The reason I thought he purposely did it was because I thought all the people here were forced to do this too. Luke told him that he joined with his friend because they thought it would be fun so they did it. After they did it once Luke wanted to do it again because he liked it so much. After they told each others storys they settiled there argument and became best friends.           ","

M197,"In this passage we see Luke's experience as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowboy gave him awareness for other people. He also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowboy Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

He fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said he had to make sure he fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

He also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

He said he saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

He also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

He and the other cowboys played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed his help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowboys program, Luke helped many others, even after he was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.              ","

M199,"Would you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys progam? I would so I can visit many places and take adventures. It seems really fun to go to Europ, China, or anywhere else he goes. It just seems really exciting to go journeys and adventures with friends, and explore the outside world.

In the passage it says ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China."" To me i don't think i would be able to stay on a boat for two weeks and a month its jsut alot of sitting down, and you dont get any rest. Its alot to do when your travling for two weeks and a month.

My argument about Luke's point of view is that it would seem pretty cool to sail and go on journeys with Luke.

He seems like a person who would love people to come along with him on his jouneys and help him explore new things, and keep watch for things, animals, and maybe people. Luke just seems like a very active person who loves people to help him explore.

I think this because he's very very active and he likes to explore. He enjoys his doing what he does if he can travel for more than two weeks. If he can explore and help out . That really shows that he loves his job.         ","

M203,"Their are three reasons why Luke's point of view convince people that they should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,he does what he likes to do,and he gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowboy's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says ""but the Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"".""It opended up a new world for him"". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,""I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,""he says.""It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs.""thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

I can support that he gets to do what he likes to when the texts says that ""Biside helping people ,I had a side benifitt of seeing

Europe and China. I can also support that he likes what hes doing when the text says ""Luke also tored and excavatede Crete and marvoloues at the Panamna Canal on his way to China.""

I can support that found free time to do fun thing when the text says the cow boys played baseball and volleyball table tennis and more fun things. They also boxed read whiting and more those are the reasons how he got to do fun things

In conclusion he did alot of things to inspire people to be a Seagoing Cow boy. If mre people were like hime the world would be a better place. ","

M204,"Luke has crossed on the atlantic ocean 16 times. It took him about two weeks to get there and back. He took care of the anmials on the crossing so that kept him busy most of the time. There is good things that happend and some bad things that happen with becoming a seagoing cowboy.

First, you need to be trained if u are not trained then why would you even go in the first place. You need to stay fit, u need to be able to survie with out food incase you run out or run out of water. Helping out on his aunts farm helped him get in shape and prepared for a real adventure. On his seconed trip he was the night watchman . That does not take so much hardwork but staying up is the key. He had to check on the animals every hour, and then tell about his hourly report. But he could not work for a while because he broke one of his ribs.

Next, he did not just go to help people even know that was his main priorty. he also went to see all thease beaituful places the would have been arriving to.

Then, they would still have fun on board it is not as bad as u think. You still get to play baseball and volleyball games where all the animals had been staying will they were on board. They played thease games to pass time, table - tennis tourmants, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

last, of all the cattle boat trips, were unbelievable opportiny for a small - town boy he says. Beside helping people getting to travel areound the world it was just brethtaking. Most of his trips were a susses I enjoyed the trips and can't wait for more.

To sum up my thoughts, I think he should go u still get fun out of this trip it is not like you have to work all day and night. He endeded up going and he had a great time. He said in this passage it opended up a whole new world for me. From day one crossing the atlantice ocean. I new right then and there this was a oppurtuntiy of a life time.  ","

In 1947 the world wars finaly ended WW1 and WW2 had a spand of 30 years. There was alot of mess to clean up and you had to be a certain person to do it. The see cowboys where just the right people.

Luke didn't know what to say, because it was an opportunity of a life time. So he decided to go, they were to go overseas to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. In 1945 they recieved there orders to New Orleans and they arrived August 14, 1945. Eventually, they headed to Greece with 335 horses also with eniugh hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned the age 18 before arriving to greece which meant he could be ready to participate for military service. When they learned he was on a cattle boat they told me to keep doing what I was doing. Luke had made 9 trips, more than any Seagoing Cowboy ever. It was an amazing opportunity for Luke, he loved visiting ancient things. Luke didn't just have to me stuck in a boat with horses he got to also go out and adventure. It took 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean, from the eastern coast of the United States. Also another month to get china, this seems like hard work. But the animals kept Luke busy, they had t be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay had to be pulled from ship to feed them. Luke had some experience by helping on Katies farm as a boy. On lukes second trip at a Seagoing Cowboy, he was to be night watchman his had to check on the animals every hour. A rainy night he had to go down a ladder, his feet slipped then a small trip of metal caught him from tumbling of the boat. He was happy to be alive, even with a few cracked ribs so he couldnt work for a couple days. Luke always had fun on board though. He got to play games which would make time go faster. Games such as volleyball, baseball, tennis and more. Being a Seagoing cowboy wasnt just an adventure he had fun to and the world open up to him. It made him aware of many opportunities. As you can tell Luke has a busy life with everything going on but he enjoys being a part of many things. Luke is glad his friend Don let him go on this trip.","

M209,"The author does not support his idea well because he has little of evidence to back up the claims that he made. These claims were that Venus could be useful because of how close it is and he called it a challenge for human curiosity. Neither of the claims he made were to vbalid becauise he would go off topic, provide little evidence, and would talk about the benefits of Venus but not say what they were.

When he claimed that Venus is useful because of how close it is and said "" ...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long frames of space travel."" and then said "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" so he made a claim saying that it is a good thing to go to venus but the right after said the value is indisputable but never gave any evidence of why its so good to go to. Then he also claimed that it has value in over coming, that it is a challenge for human curiosity. This is a bad claim because he did not have much evidence or reason to back up going to Venus so he said "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This claim would be much better if he actually listed any good benefits from Venus. Also through the text the author seems to either run out of things to support his claim or he went off topic because he started to talk about what NASA is doing and planning to do to explore Venus like "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions would be to allow scientist to float above the fray."" He would say thing of what people might be able to do to explore Venus with its hostile conditions but he still never said what could be discovered while exploring.

I don't disagree on his point but how he executes getting it across to the audience does not work. If he provided any solid evidence on what could be learned or discovered on Venus like technology or new elements then it would bring more people behind this idea. But that still does not change the fact that his claims of Venus is useful for future visits and its a good challenge for human curiosity, are not valid and he does not to a good jobs of supporting his claims.","

M210,"Luke Bomberger was working at the grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist came up to him and invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe.

Luke and Don signed up to go on the ship to Europe. They had to be ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

He went to Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""he says. ""Besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke had a fun time seeing all these places, you can tell by how well he explaines them. By the way he explaines this, he should really be encouraging people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. He makes it sound like it is alot of fun. Luke also found time to have fun on board, the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. By being a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke says that it makes him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Luke and the cowboys played things games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing,reading, and more. Luke just doesnt get to have fun, but he does get to explore things during his trips like getting the chance to visist oher countries. Lukes job is pretty fun although it can be very dangerous. Luke has to stay up through the night sometimes no matter what the weather is and watch and take care of all of the animals on board. That part doesnt seem so dangerous does it? The dangerous part is being careful of where you go and where you step. One night luke was on the ship taking care of the animals and accidentaly slipped and almsot slid off the ship and fell in to the dark, deep Atlantic ocean. He was very happy to still be alive, but he still broke his ribs and couldnt work for a while.

If you love to travle and be on the sea then this is a perfect job for you. On the job you go to new plarts of the world.

why you shouldn't join is because you might fall overboard and noone might noice that you fell. Or the ship might fail at working and sink and you might not have a boat incase that might happen. What if the ship gets hit and you all start to sink.

Luke said being a cowboy is much more than a adverture for Luke Bombeger. Also being a cowboy opened the world to him and he is greatful for that opportunity of being a cowboy. He also said it make him more aware of people in countries and their needs.

M221,"Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowboys program because he thinks since when he were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching him how to survive on his own he's getting taught and he is changing during this program so thats what he thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after his high school graduation. he was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he trys to encourage people to join the program.

M224,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a big honor. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to help animals, you can vist many places, you learn responsibility, and you get to have fun on board after the animals are uploaded.

I know this becasue in the text it says UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason is in paragraph 9 it says Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grtaeful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Those are some resons to join the Seagoing Cowboys. You get to help animals, you vist new places, and you learn responsibility. That is why you should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys.","

M225,"Luke Bomberger is a who had started working in a grocery story and a bank, just when he got out of high school. Once he went on this trip to Europe with his friend Don Reist. Luke started enjoying going to oversea trips, even though he knew it would take a long time. Have you ever wanted to take an oversea trip? If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration. Its for SEagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything! Taking care of animals is another thing to, if you absolutely love animals than of course you might want to join. Especially if you are a farmer boy.

Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas. I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life. When Luke was on that trip he loved it, he first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended , on August 14th. On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger! Keep in mind that you can see animals , help people, and you can also visit places you have never visited in your whole life.","

M226,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !","

M227,"Luke Bomberger became a Seagoing Cowboy he helps people whose lives had been affected by World War ll. Luke became a Seagoing

Cowboy because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as he says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

In conclusion Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowboy he loves all the sights, all the help that he can give to these other people, and that he could have this opportunity in life.                  ","

He went to china and the great wall of china and helepd during that process of people starving being hedydrated and alot more.

While on the ship he had to feed all of the animals. Clean up for them. Water all of the plants,and make sure all the bales of hay and bags of oats are still good. On the second night he was on night patrol. he had to guard the ship and make sure the coast guard knew who he was.

M230,"You should really join the Seagoing Cowboys because they have lots of fun even though it might seem scary to be on a boat with horses then yes but it is actually pretty safe. Luke may have broke a few ribs and other stuff but he had fun and if you live on a farm then you would be good for it because you have to clean out stalls and feed them and put out bals of hay for them to munch on. You could be on the next boat to be a Seagoing Cowboy of Cowgirl. You may have to do night patroll but it don't matter as long as youhave fun. Maybe even bring a friend so you don't feel so lonely if you don't know anyone.

If you don't like boats then don't do it if you like boats and horses then your the one to apply and we will send you a ticket to get on the boat and be on your way. If you want to see the world or some parts of it then sign up and come join us because we go everywhere you can imagine like China, New Zealand, and Crete. These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when he came other than the friend that asked him to go with him to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke made many new friends on the boat. He made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that he had with that job. He had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

He thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but he changed his mind it being completely amazing better than what he thought it would be for someone like him. His journeys were amazing and he loved it and his family was very proud of him and his friend. He said he is grateful for the opportunity. He also said it made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. The awareness stayed with him and it lead his family to host many of international students and exchange visiters and students for many years.

This is Lukes story and this is why you should join. ","

M231,"Luke Bomberger works at a grogrocery store and a bank, he wants to get a better job. His good friend Don Reist gave him an opportunity of a lifetime. Don had invited him to got to Europe on a cattle boat, he excepted the invite. Luke just knew that this would change his life.

In the middle of the story people realized that people, animals, and more looked dried out, so 44 nations had joined to form UNRRA and hired ""Seagoing Cowboys.""Luke and Don had signed up for it, knowing that they were going to help animals. When they had arrived from taking the animals to New Orleans the day the Pacific War had ended. They had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed them. Luke had recently turned 18 before arriving to Greece. He had made 9 trips before being discharged.

I think that thanks to Don, Luke had gotten a great job just for him. I also think that Luke enjoyed the buisness he was in and what he was doing. Don is very encouraging, helpful, nice, and thanks to all of that he had gotten his friend,Luke, a job. Luke had later began helping his auntie on the farm and it prepared him for hard work. This story or passage is something that I would read again and again. It is very interesting and different.

M232,"Have you ever tried becoming a seagoing cowboy? If not, I suggest that you consider joining the program. The job of a seagoing cowboy is to take care of horses, young cows, and mules which are sent overseas to people that need them. While being in the Seagoing Cowboy program, there are many positive things such as being able to experience adventures, visiting many unique places, and having the opportunity to help people in need.

A Seagoing Cowboy is able to experience many adventures. When Luke was a seagoing cowboy, he had the chance of experiencing a storm while at sea. Think about how exciting and adventurous that would be! Also Luke says that he found time to have fun on board, especially once all the animals were taken care of or unloaded. The cowbobys would then play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds, or set up different sporting tournements. Experiencing a storm at sea and playing many fun games on board are just two examples of the many adventures that could take place as a seagoing cowboy.

If you are a seagoing cowboy, you not only have adventures but you also can see and visit many unique places that an average person wouldn't have the opportunity to see or experience. In Luke's nine years as a seagoing cowboy, he was able to see and experience some pretty interesting things in Europe and China. He specifically saw the Acropolis in Greece, and thought that that experience was very special. On top of seeing the Acropolis, he also was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. There would also be many more places to go and people to see.

The main reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be to help people in need. Luke specifically helped people affected by World War II. The people affected by World War II needed food, clothing, animals, and more. Luke helped with the animals. Luke states that he was very grateful for the opportunity of becoming a seagoing cowboy so he could help people in need. He says that it made him ""more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Becoming a seagoing cowboy is a great experience and very beneficial. Luke says, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" ","

Luke made nine trips and was brave to make that choice. But lukes friend decided to invite luke on this trip so luke was pretty glad that his friend invited him. then luke and his friend were asked to take care of horses,young cows,and mules.

Luke then decided to take his traveling a whole new level especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Luke decided to play games on board like basball,volleyball,table tennis he was also fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. well being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. Luke had so much fun being a seagoing cowboy. and leading his family hosts a number of international students and exchange vistors for many and many years so when people bring up seagoing cowboys they can remenber that it is a jorney.

His idea is not supported all that well. He used more of what he thought than facts.

He needs to uses sources and support his sources. He even goes back to the dangerous that each one can lead to. He does not stay strong in just one idea, he circles back to the other idea. A qoute from the text that proves my point is "" Modern computers are enormously powerful and flexible and quick. but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

He always has a reason behind why it won't work or why it is dangroues. the author may feel like he needs to put why it wouldn work or the dnagerous but it just makes their writing weaker

In conclusion the author does not support his idea well. He has conflicting sides and he always seems to have a reasons why it could be dangroues. He also seems to have very little facts they are mostly just opions. The author needed to stick to one idea and find facts to support that reason. Intead of just going back and forth between ideas.

M239,"Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War ll. In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowboy, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowboys in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowboys.      ","

M240,"Why do you think Don Reist want Luke Bomberger to join the Seagoing Cowboys program ? Well , i think he wants him to join the Seagoing cowboys program because he probably really like it , and want his friend to join .

One reason i think Luke joined because like he say , he think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime . in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended .

Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend , and do what he are doing now . The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service .

The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . ""            ","

M241,"Luke's claim was that when his friend Don invited him to a trip to Europe on a cattle boat and Luke knew right away he had to say yes because it was a once

in a lifetime opportunity. Also that he got to travel and exploer many diffrent

places! Another one of Lukes claim was that he was greatful for the opportunity he got to have by being a seagoing cowboy.

A few reasons to join the club it that you get to go places you probobly never been before. Also that you get to travel all over the world and explore diffrent places and see many diffrent things from many diffrent paces, just like Luke!

It may have taken him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china but, it may have been worth it because Luke got to see many diffrent things and explore unique stuff! Luke would normally be caring for the animals and so it kept him busy for a long time.The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games so, if you like those games you might want to join them! Being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun than an adventure, it opened the world to Luke. Luke said he was greatful for the opportunity.

"" I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. "" That is what Luke said because he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy and going on all the adventures that Luke got to do! Maybe one day if you become a seagoing cowboy you will be able to adventure all the things Luke got to do. There may

be some rough time like what Luke had when he couldn't work for a few days, for an example,

when he was a watchman and it was a rainy night Luke sliped

and fell and he had a few broken ribs but he was saved by a small strip of metal

along the edge so it stopped Luke from sliding. Luke aws happy to be alive

though! Luckly for Luke he recovered in a few days. Luke was happy to be a cowboy and you might too!

So now maybe you can consider about being a saegoign cowboy.                                         ","

The first reson why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. You should be a Seagoing Cowboy because you can have many adventures. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, I took many trips. I went to New Orleans, Greece, China, and many more places.

The thing that prepared me was when I worked at Aunt Katie's farm when I was little. But somtimes it can be dangeruos. One night I was caring for the animals, and I slipped off of a latter. When I fell off the latter, I cracked a couple off my ribs.

Why else should you be a Seagoing Cowboy? You sould be a Seagoing Cowboy because you can meet new people from all around the world. When I went on to be a Seagoing Cowboy, I had my friend Don Reist. He is the one that asked me if I wanted to going with him.

M247,"Do you know what a seagoing cowboy is? Luke Bomberger was a ''seagoing cowboy'',a person who helped foreign countries of sea's after WWII. Luke was apart of the UNRRA, (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)to help foreign country's who have been left in ruins get back on their feet. On his way to Europe,he had to cross the large and vast Atlantic Ocean.

To pass time on there way to Europe they played games such as,Table-Tennis,fencing,and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass time. The way Luke got into the seagoing cowboy business,was his friend asked him if he wanted to join him,and he couldn't pass up this surreal oppurtunity. But, the downside was he he had to travel the rambunctious sea's. The ship Luke and Don boarded to take these cattle over to Europe is the SS Charles W. Wooster.

Reasons join this program are that you get to help others get back on their feet in times of disaster such as war,hurricane,tsunami,nuclear disaster,or other types of disasters that may happen. But their also some dangers to be aware of. During one of Luke's journey's to Europe he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. If it weren't for a small strip of metal he would have fallen into the dark Atlantic Ocean. But,besides broken ribs he was glad he wasn't sleeping with the fishes,literally!

It's also an adventure to. During another one of his trips he got to boat around the watery ""streets"" of Venice,Italy in a gondola. Also while in Greece he visited a excavated castle. He also marveled the Panama Canal on his way to

China. But,what came most in handy is that he used to help his Aunt Katie on her farm as a boy so, Luke was prepared for the hard work.

So as a conclusion to this story, I would hope you join an organization that helps others in need, especially countries overseas. Even though this job might be hard, your making a difference in our world and there's. You could join an orginization like UNRRA,or just simply join and orginization that helps new Americans,like immigrants from foreign countries fit in in our society today in America. That would be a good example our country could set for other countries. This should be our goal for every thing and anything. Are goal should be to help others and just not ourselves. We need to stop being selfish and help other's get back on there feet if their in times of need. This is the example we should set as The United States of America.","

M249,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than just taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls for the animals.

Doing this, it could open up your eyes to a new world and explore new places.

Luke though it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

The fact that Luke thought helping all of those people in need, shows you that he wanted to help them.

But, not only was he taking care of the people and helping them, he was also helping the animals. I think he also liked taking care of the animals himself.

When people think of a Cowboy, they see someone wearing cowboy boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowboy, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

He also marveled at the Panama Canal, during his trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, he must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a new world to you. Not only does it let you visit new and unique places, you get to help animals and people that are in need of it.

It sure was like that to luke.","

M251,"""Hmmmm, i think it would be great to have others in the Seagoing Cowboys program."" Luke Bomberger is apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program and thinks it would be great if new faces would join the program as well. So Luke is thinking about how he'd get the message out to people so they could probably be in the program. ''I should talk to the others and see what they think."" Luke said, so he spreads the word to the other guys and they all think it's a great idea. Luke was amazed everyone was wanting others to join the program also. All of a sudden luke thought to himself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So he told the guys that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the guys blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here."" So the other guys gave him a high five and telling him that's an brilliant idea. So the guys took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where. So Luke lead the the group of gentlemen in the little radio station and spoted an old man drinking coffe just sitting there. So as soon as Luke said 'Excuse me sir?.'' The old man jumped up instantainioulsy and said, 'AHHH! who are you and what do you want?"". So all the gentlemen introduced theirselfs and told the old man how trhey needed to let others know about their program and how they needed his help. So the old man responded with, ""What's in it for me?"" the gentlemen thought for a moment and one said, 'Oh i know, if you let us use your thingy majigger here you can leave this boring job and come with us."" So the old man thought for a moment and then said ""Deal"". So the old man turned on his machine to have all the guys on the radio then he counted down ""3...2...1...and action."" So Luke spoke first and said ''Gentlemen and gentlemen come one come all to be apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program."" then he gave out all the infomation then in less in two minutes the radio station started to get dozens of phone calls and all the men that called were excepted and flew out to where all the other men were. Three day later it was time to take off and get ready to start sailing so Lucas did a head count. The program started out with 24 members but when Lucas was done counting the program had 148 members in all. Lucas was happy with the success and progress that was made, so everyone got settled in and started to sail.","

All of a sudden luke thought to himself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So he told the guys that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the guys blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here."" So the other guys gave him a high five and telling him that's an brilliant idea. So the guys took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where. So Luke lead the the group of gentlemen in the little radio station and spoted an old man drinking coffe just sitting there. So as soon as Luke said 'Excuse me sir?.'' The old man jumped up instantainioulsy and said, 'AHHH! who are you and what do you want?"". So all the gentlemen introduced theirselfs and told the old man how trhey needed to let others know about their program and how they needed his help. So the old man responded with, ""What's in it for me?"" the gentlemen thought for a moment and one said, 'Oh i know, if you let us use your thingy majigger here you can leave this boring job and come with us."" So the old man thought for a moment and then said ""Deal"". So the old man turned on his machine to have all the guys on the radio then he counted down ""3...2...1...and action."" So Luke spoke first and said ''Gentlemen and gentlemen come one come all to be apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program."" then he gave out all the infomation then in less in two minutes the radio station started to get dozens of phone calls and all the men that called were excepted and flew out to where all the other men were. Three day later it was time to take off and get ready to start sailing so Lucas did a head count. The program started out with 24 members but when Lucas was done counting the program had 148 members in all. Lucas was happy with the success and progress that was made, so everyone got settled in and started to sail.]""

Would you like to be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you don't, I am going to tell you about a text I read about a man. In this text, it says that a man named Luke Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA, a relief and rehabilitation administration. UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and his friend Don signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the text it also says that Luke went on cattle-boat trips. He also got to go to many places across the country. He also found time to have fun on board, ecspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That oppotunity of a lifetime is good to have because you could experience adventures you have never experienced before, and that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It is not all just fun and games for Luke. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second tripLuke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, After making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first towardan opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happyto be alive. But he couldn't work a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful the opportunity.""

M261,"The Seagoing Cowboy Heros

Do you like going to new places around the world? Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you would, then go to China. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected bt World War 2.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. He had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recovert their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reson is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

The cowboys played baseeball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worlkd to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness styaed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. So, after i gave you reasons and supported my answer with details, would you want to go to Seagoing Cowboys program?? ","

M262,"Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. When his friend Don asked him to go on a cattle boat Luke couldn't say no. It was and opportunity of a life time and Luke knew it. In 1945 the World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins.44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Rlief and Rehabilition Administration).They hired seagoing cowboys to take care of all the animals. So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that he could be drafed at any time to go to war. When he told them that he was on a cattle-boatr trip they told him to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow boy has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town boy Luke say. besides helping people he also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when he saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to him Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little he helped his aunt Katie's farm ou when he was a boy and he has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach him the dangers of the sea though. When he was on his secened trip he was a night watchman. He had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of him helping on a farm when he was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When he was reporting to the captin one time he slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop him from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and his life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got. I found out that that peice of meatal craked his ribs so he could not work for a acouple of days witch that might of hert his body every day till it was helled but i do nt know because i am not Luke and that is the end of my story.

M263,"The Author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well in this writting. Teh author is good at showing the two diffrernent sides to the agument but makes you agree with his stance. He used many diffrent examples and also gae a lot of detail in his writting.

To start off his essay with some facts and expalined what he was going to be talking about and some things about planets. One fact he used to start his essay off was "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" ( paragraph 3) This was a great way to start off the writting because he informed his readers about venus before he started to persaude them on a topic.

The author also displaces the oposing information which is always a good thing to do in a pusasive writting. An example of this is "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for human."" ( Paragraph 5) This is higlighing that yes Venus has some dangerous things but is still worthy. So by doing this he is showing the dangers but then can back them up and say some good things about them.

Following this, The author was really good at making the dangerous stuff sound not as bad, one example of this is ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely for above teh planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrated the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" (paragraph 6) This supports that he is a good authour and deplaning his stance on the agurmeny becasue he can make the other side information help his stance in an way.

In conclusion, the author did a great job at suporting his idea. The diffrent ways of supporting it made it seem more persasive and he got across alot of ideas and information.                  ","

M265,They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy. Also you will learn how to travel the seas and survive in cold wheather. So being in the program could be fun because you will learn how to be a cowboy. Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. To train to be a cowboy you have go through obstacles and overcome your fears so you can travel the seas. You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies. You also defenitely need to be strong so you can overcome your fears and fight bad guys so you can take them down so that is why you need to be strong. You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation you will know how to get out of the bad situation so you won't get hurt while you are in the bad situation so that is why need to learn how to get out of a bad situation. You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. ,"

""[Essay Content: M265 / They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy. Also you will learn how to travel the seas and survive in cold wheather. So being in the program could be fun because you will learn how to be a cowboy. Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. To train to be a cowboy you have go through obstacles and overcome your fears so you can travel the seas. You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies. You also defenitely need to be strong so you can overcome your fears and fight bad guys so you can take them down so that is why you need to be strong. You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation you will know how to get out of the bad situation so you won't get hurt while you are in the bad situation so that is why need to learn how to get out of a bad situation. You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. ]""

M267,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains that studying Venus is a worthy approach despite the dangers. The author impressively supports that the mission to Venus is worth it despite the dangers that might come with it. In the article he provides examples, uses a credible source, and also views the other side. By doing these things it made his point credible and also stronger to the reader.

In the article he provides the example of a floating car above venus to show that a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the conditions but it would provide little sight. He uses to example to illustrate what it would be like to avoid the conditionsby showing this is what the would have to do. He also provides examples to an alternative by saying that there could be electronics to avoid the risks. By providing both of these examples it gives the reader some relateable examples to get an insight into his point.

NASA is a world wide administration that has credibility over the course of its govern. By providing examples of what NASA is doing to show that it should be done, then if NASA is working on it then it makes his point credible. He quotes NASA'S approches on studying Venus so that it can avoid the risks to show that it is possible to explore Venus without the risks. A NASA solution would be that a person could float above the fray. They also have considered sending electronices so it is possible. He saying that it might be difficult but it is attainable. This supports the claim that he supports his claim impresively because he uses sources.

In most arguments the person views the other side so that they can provide an alternative to what they are saying. He uses cons such as no mission has had a man, 97% of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth, and that it could crash a submarine. But then he says that Venus has benefits to that out way the dangers. The benfits include: it is the brightest point, it is close to Earth compared to other space travels, long ago it could support life, and it will expand the edges of imagination and innovation. He provides benefits to out weigh the cons of exploring Venus. He does a great job of explaining why exploring Venus has value and can provides insight to other counter arguments that might rise from others opionions. This is why he does an impressive job supporting his argument.

In conclusion, the author provided points in the argument to make the opinion more credible and also stronger to the reader. In the article the author provided examples, a wide known credible source, and viewed the other side. He impressively supported his opinon that the mission to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Without his evidence to suppport his opinion the article would have not had such an impact on the reader. This is why he did an impressive job supporting his idea.     ","

M268,"The Seagonig Cowboys are a group of people who helped serve after World War 2. They brought horses and small cows to towns that were in ruins. To help these countrys they brought food and cattle. They went across the Pacific and Atlantic ocean to give the homeless food.

People should join this program because it help a town in need of assistance. If they didnt they could starve to death. They need to join this program not just for the people you are helping but to help yourself see the good inside yourself. Take Luke, he is a seagoing cowboy that made 9 trips. That is the longest any seagoing cowboy has ever went.

It clearly states on paragraph 5 that "" Besides helping people, I had a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" He also says it is an oppertunity of a lifetime. He said he couldnt say no. He says it takes about 2 weeks to get across the Alantic ocean. He went over the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific ocean twice to help those affected by World War 2.

In conclusion, people should join the seagoing cowboys. There are many side benifits of doing so. You could things you could never see and still help people. So, will you join the seagoing cowboys?","

M269,"Luke should use these reason's to convince other people. The program helps with people in need, people around the world that need supplies, and livestock. The Seagoing Coyboys program is a program for helping other's.

The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for helping others. To sum marize the reasons. The program helps with people in need, the program goes around the world, and the program helps with livestock and supplies. Luke did a great thing to help with the world. ","

M270,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That is why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.   ","

M272,"Do you want to hear a story? so i was at work cause im a scientist an me in my friend had an agrument about what happen to mars about the facemark.

The agrument started because we were talking talking about it an he said that a alien put it there i said impossible. So he got mad at me i said state your reason why you think a alien put it there. He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and he said the picture look like alien heads.

Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. The argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.

Last, we came together an said we dont know cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien.

""[Essay Content: M272 / Do you want to hear a story? so i was at work cause im a scientist an me in my friend had an agrument about what happen to mars about the facemark.

The agrument started because we were talking talking about it an he said that a alien put it there i said impossible. So he got mad at me i said state your reason why you think a alien put it there. He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and he said the picture look like alien heads.

Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. The argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.

Last, we came together an said we dont know cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien. He did not like my response when i said i dont know how they look how they sound thats why i said it was not a alien. It also kept going cause i did not like his response he did give me details or nothing.

M274,"There could be reasons of how you can join the program. There is a lot of reasons. Luke had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Luke signed up to join the program, which is, UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrations). The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" because they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and his friend signed up and they went to New Orleans. They found horses there. They keep on going to places, that was like an adventure to them. They keep on going and they were arriving to Greece for their second mission.

Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" Luke was also taking a ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water too. He was looking at a lot of things in Greece. His next stop was at China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlanta Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was so busy taking care of the animals. He took so many adventures. Being a Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him.

There was a lot of adventures going on. It took him years to go around the world and explore. He was great of being a Seagoing Cowboy. He even loved to going to this mini adventures. It was a great experinced.           ","

M275,"He did a good job supporting his idea, i see that he keeps comparing it to earth. He said that Venus is the closest planet to earth. He also said the air pressure of Venus would be cose to that of sea level on earth.

However venus is the hottest planet but is second from the sun. I personally ould not go to Venus even if i had a chance. He also mentioned that Venus doesnt have easy conditions but are survivable for humans.

The author also explained that the atmosphere would liquefy many metals. If so it would be very dangerous to go to Venus unless the structure is strong enough to pass thru the atmosphere. There is a 97 percent carbon dioxide atmosphere that blankets Venus.

You can tell this aurthor did some research before writing this. He is very detailed in this passage. All in all i think this aurthor did a very nice job writing this passage and backing himself up by details.   ","

M276,"In ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke joined the program because his friend Don Reist asked him if he wanted to come with.

He knew it would be a once in a lifetime opprotunity, and because he would go to different countries.

In paragraph two it said,""World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.""

To help these countries recover 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA to give them food supplies, animals , and more.

The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" were hired to take care of the animals onboard the ship as they were shipped overseas.

They also had to clean the animals stalls and give them food and water.

Luke liked doing it so much that he did it many more times.

He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II.

When they were coming back they played games in th eempty stalls to pass the time.

In conclusion,

I believe that you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to help the people can be affected by any wars or other things.","

So if I were you I would take as many chances as I could.

For one Bomberger had a blast traveling to many different places, it says in paragraph 5 he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the panama canal on his way to China .Crazy amazing, right? He was admiring one place on his way to another. What a lucky guy.

Another thing is Bomberger Got to go places that many people may never go. For example He had been to China, Eastern coast of the US, and Europe. Way farther out of North America then Ill ever be. He was probably millions of miles away from where his comfort zone (his house).

Also just the over-all experience you get when you do or try something new. Bomberger states in paragraph 9 that being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun of an adventure. Its all about the people you share the moment with also, they could make it adventerious, scary, fun, or sad.

But do you see getting pushed of of a 1,000,000,000,000 building (your comfort zone) can be fun, scary, or of course uncomfortable. So next time you want to say no to some thing, take chances and say YES. ","

M279,"Why should you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Well first let me tell you about a boy named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowboy. A Seagoing Cowboy is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowboys. To go help Europe where World War II just ended.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do. He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make his hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Take the information that I gave you. Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you. ","

M281,"Luke had no idea that his life was about to change. He has two part time jobs at a bank and a grocery store. His friend Don had asked him if he wanted to go on a cattle boat to Europe because after World War II it left most cities in ruins. Luke had no choice but to say yes. So in August of 1945 Luke and Don went to New Orleans to take apart in helping families. After getting their papers from the seaman they went and borded the SS Charles W. Wooster, they headed for Greece with a cargo of 355 plus horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke ended up turning 18 before arriving at Greece. Luke realized that he could be drafted for military service but everyone just told him to what he's doing now as his military service. On his second trip he served as night watchman after doing his hourly report to the captian it was a rainy night and the ladders were slick and Luke slipped down the ladder on his backside and almost feel feet first out of the ship into the dark Dark Atlantic Ocean. But a small piece of metal caught and saved him. He was happy to be alive. But he couldn't do anything for a couple days because of some cracked ribs. Luke said it's more fun on the way back because when they drop off the animals the stalls are empty and they can play games like baseball, table tennis, and volleyball. They all say it's one thing that cuts time off the journey. Luke also made nine trips the most anyone has ever made. THat is why Luke likes being a Seagoing Cowboy.","

M282,"Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". The author did not support his topic very well, because he didn't support his main idea enough, he strayed away from the topic many times, and his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.

First, the author brings up his topic of "" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring. Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea. The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out. One of the points brought up was ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth"". The author uses the word ""probably"" which means that he doesn't know this to be a fact or not. The author also wrote ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus"" ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus. A good informative or arguementative essay provides facts to supports its ideas, rather than just guessing or presuming.

The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the ""danger"" aspect of it, and he should focus more on the ""why"" aspect of his idea . So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.","

M286,"Luke Bomberger had got asked to join this program called '' Seagoing Cowboys.""

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that. It shows how you canbe helpful and you need to be greatful for what you have and dont have!","

M287,"You should join Seagoing Cowboys program! You might be thinking right now well why should I join this program? You should join because UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care or the horses, young cows, and mules that where shipped overseas. Its a important job to take care of the animals there our resource! You get to see and vist amazing places! And when you are in the program you get to help people out and help them recover. Its a good and nice thing that you are helping people out.

In the book ''A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'' A character from that book name Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime! In 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries where left ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).

Then in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14. Luke then says,''the day the Pacific war ended.''

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Then Luke was on a cattle-boat trip, they told Luke to just keep doing that for Luke's service. Luke was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. For Luke the cattle-boat trips where unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says.

Besides Luke helping people, he had side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special for Luke. And Luke got to go to a gondola ride in Venice , Italy,a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Maybe if you Join the Seagoing Cowboys program you can experience all these wonderful places like Luke did! And you can be helpful in this program.

On Luke second trip, he had to serve as night watchman. And his job was to check on all the animals every hour. Now, thats a tough job to do. But Luke was helpful and he did his job and he loves his job he does. To sum things up the jobs sometimes be a little hard to do but Luke never gave up on his job! So this is why you should join the program and help people out like Luke and Don did.","

M290,"This story is about Luke Bomberger a boy who rode the waves had no idea that his life would change soon after his graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and at a bank when his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no he knew it would be an opportunity for him. It was 1945,world war 2 was over in Europe and countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover 44 nations came together and started UNRRA {The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration}. UNRRA hired seagoimg cowboys to take care of the horses,young cows, and the mules.

The first reason to join the program is because they came together and started a group of 44 nations to help Europe. They hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to help the animals. They are trying to get the nation back together. Luke and Don signed up for it to. Heading over seas in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived ''August 14,'' Luke sayed,the day the Pacific war ended.''

The second reason you should join the group is because '' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' he said.''Besides helping people, had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,'' he says. ''So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.'' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.

The third reason why you should join the group is cause caring for the animals during the crossings kept luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hayand bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work.

In conclusion I think you can still help with or without an reward. He did that from heart to help and sign up for that, also he liked watching the animals every hour and taking care of them so did his friend. He really liked the trips around the world too, just help to be nice somtimes for other people.","

M292,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience. You don't only help people, but you also get a benefit of seeing amazing places. If you love animals you can take care of them. You get to have fun and know that you're doing something that helps others.

Luke was just a small town boy and he got a great opportunity. First he had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank. Luke was invited to be a Seagoing Cowboy by his friend Don. He accepted it and knew he was going to have a lifetime opportunity.

Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowboys played lots of games.

They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time.

Luke said that ""being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure."" For Luke it opened up the world to him. Luke had a lot of fun seeing different sites, meeting new people, playing fun games and caring for people in a different, and better way.                       ","

Just think how good you would feel if you knew that you saved people lives just by giving them food. Well i'm going to tell you what it would feel like and why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Just think of becoming a true life hero, you could become a soldier,nurse,doctor, or a Seagoing Cowboy! Seagoing Cowboys were people (men) who transported Cows, Mules, and Horses. They transported them from America to Europe,Greece,and China. Europe was left in ruins after World War || was over, so people signed up to become a Seagoing Cowboy. They would get on ships with 300+ horses, cows, and mues and enough hay and oats to feed them. A Seagoing Cowboy would check up on them every hour to make sure the animals were alright. Wow what a job.

This story is mainly about how great Seagoing Cowboys are and what they bring to other countries. They transported animals to other countries who didn't have food or transportation. Seagoing Cowboys were true heroes, they cared for animals and people. They had kind hearts for both of them.      ","

M299,"Luke's point of veiw if you wanna join or participate the saegoing cowboys is he said it was an opportunity of a lifetime, so you get to do it once. Another reason that Luke thought you should join or partcipate is you can take care of horses,young cows,and mules that are being shipped overseas. You also get to feeed the horses.When you have time on the ship you can play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games to pass the time. It even opens up the world for you to discover.

When Luke was discovering the world he was grateful for the opportunity and it also made him aware of people of other countries and their needs. Luke also made 16 trips around the Alantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 2 times to help people who were affected by World War ll. Another reason to join the Seagoing cowboys program is you can see the people in needs who got their houses destroyed in World War ll. When Luke was in the Seagoing Cowboys program he visited many unique places like New Orleans,Greece,Europe,China and he also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy and also toured a excavated castle in Crete.

You should be careful while being a watchman in the dark because Luke slid on a slippery ladder on his backside. A small strip oh metal stopped his slide from flying overboard. He was happy to be alive but he couldn't work for a couple days of his cracked ribs. Also Luke travled on the Charles w. Wooster and as heading to Greece. It will take 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean. Also what he did on the ship is he cleaned stalls which you might have to do.The last thing he did was help out in the kitchen. You have to help cook in the kitchen.","

""[Essay Content: M299 / Luke's point of veiw if you wanna join or participate the saegoing cowboys is he said it was an opportunity of a lifetime, so you get to do it once. Another reason that Luke thought you should join or partcipate is you can take care of horses,young cows,and mules that are being shipped overseas. You also get to feeed the horses.When you have time on the ship you can play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games to pass the time. It even opens up the world for you to discover.

When Luke was discovering the world he was grateful for the opportunity and it also made him aware of people of other countries and their needs. Luke also made 16 trips around the Alantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 2 times to help people who were affected by World War ll. Another reason to join the Seagoing cowboys program is you can see the people in needs who got their houses destroyed in World War ll. When Luke was in the Seagoing Cowboys program he visited many unique places like New Orleans,Greece,Europe,China and he also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy and also toured a excavated castle in Crete.

You should be careful while being a watchman in the dark because Luke slid on a slippery ladder on his backside. A small strip oh metal stopped his slide from flying overboard. He was happy to be alive but he couldn't work for a couple days of his cracked ribs. Also Luke travled on the Charles w. Wooster and as heading to Greece. It will take 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean. Also what he did on the ship is he cleaned stalls which you might have to do.The last thing he did was help out in the kitchen. You have to help cook in the kitchen.]""

M300,"Some resones to join the program are that you can help people after they have had a hard time. The situation from the text is after World War ll there was alot of destruction in Europe. So Luke went over to Europe to help people get thier lives back. Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all just work you also got to travle the world and see cool places. He said that he and other people on the boat had fun on the way back.

He said that he saw some cool places, and did cool thing, like seeing the Panama Canal or go on a gandola ride in Veince, Italy. Whe the stalls were emty ,he said, that alot of guys on the ship would play games to make the time pass. Some of the games that he had mentoined were baseball, volleyball, table tennis, and many others. They helped pass the time by playing games, is what he said.

I think that he made it sound very appealing to be a Seagoing Cowboy it definetily had it's up's an down's. Like cleaning the stals would be a down, and a up would be playing games. Also being able to go see and do things in other parts of the world.        ","

That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was her job over there in Europe.

She kept going there and she kept helping others. She like her job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town girl it had said. She really enjoyed her job. She toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowgirl. She traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took her about 2 weeks.

She was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. She had helped out her aunt Katie as a girl. So she was prepared for this. On her second trip she was served as a night watchman. Her job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night she had slipped down on a slippery ladder. Her heart raced. But luckly she lived.

This ssums up about everythung. Her life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to her friend Don. She liked helping out. She couldnt work though because she had cracked ribs. After that she returned to being a seagoing cowgirl. Then it made her more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need.               ","

M-F5,"Luke should not be a sea going cowgirl.This is why in paragraph 2 she said when she went over seas world war ll was begining, if she was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat she was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when she was on the boat she had an hourly role call acording to the story she fell and cracked her ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop her she would have went over board and eaten by a shark but she was fine she had to take a break for a couple of days. Why she should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowgirl is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if she keeps up what she is doing she will get really hurt do her job any more. In paragrah4 when she was discharged she had made nine trips across the world

M-F6,"I think that Luke should get back in the Seagoing Cowgirls program,because then she can see the sea, and she like's to take care of the animals she get's different types of job's while she's there the problem is that she craked some ribs, so she wont be able to get back in the program for a while if it wasnt for her friend she wouldn't have been in the program at all I think that Luke really likes her job she gets to see the world as she is going around the world if I was in the Seagoing Cowgirls program I would want to stay because it would be fun to be able to visit new type's of places most of the time i would want to help the animals! because I would have to check up on them like every hour just like Luke she didn't know she was going to be in the program but they just told her what to do unitl she get's back she she just got done with high school and now she has to deal with the seas it seems like she wants to go back home so she can finsh her two job's and then she could go to collage either way i tink that she was a good gal in the Seagoing Cowgirls progarm ","

""[Essay Content: M-F6 / I think that Luke should get back in the Seagoing Cowgirls program,because then she can see the sea, and she like's to take care of the animals she get's different types of job's while she's there the problem is that she craked some ribs, so she wont be able to get back in the program for a while if it wasnt for her friend she wouldn't have been in the program at all I think that Luke really likes her job she gets to see the world as she is going around the world if I was in the Seagoing Cowgirls program I would want to stay because it would be fun to be able to visit new type's of places most of the time i would want to help the animals! because I would have to check up on them like every hour just like Luke she didn't know she was going to be in the program but they just told her what to do unitl she get's back she she just got done with high school and now she has to deal with the seas it seems like she wants to go back home so she can finsh her two job's and then she could go to collage either way i tink that she was a good gal in the Seagoing Cowgirls progarm ]""

M-F7,"Luke made a good idea to join the Seagoing cowgirls. But she also made a bad disision to take time out of her time to make it where she could play with her own friends and if I were her I would join but I woulnt because it would be bad if I couldnt get to hang out with my friends.

She might have joined because she wanted to help other people because she might have wanted to help load the cattle and not hang out with her friends but if she were to travel to anouther place away from her friends she would be sad and so would I.I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl but we all have our own ideas. She wanted to change her life by doing good for otherr people and not just her self. Luke wants a experiance adventure with the seagoing cowgirls but she cant do that if she dosnt have experance.

Luks parents wouldnt let her go if she didnt argue with them. You know why she wouldnt have arguied with her parents they might have sugested her going over to join the seagoing cowgirls. That is why I think she should go.","

M-F9,"I think one reason to join is because she helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because she got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also she had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also she visited many unique places while she was on the trip as she did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how she felt being on the trip and telling them how she helped all of these peaople. Also she told us why she kept on going out and doing/helping anyone she could. Another way she claimed her reason's is by telling us how and what she did on her free time from wherehe was at. Also her emotion tells us how she claimed some parts of her reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's her reason's because one she used her emotion by saying how she felt when she was there. Second She said that she had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least she told us what she did on her free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.

M-F11,"A argument Luke is dealing with from her point of view is how much things she has to do and if she does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job she was so excited about it. She heard that being a Seagoing Cowgirl was a amazing job. She has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowgirl because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowgirls, she couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, she was so excited to start working. She worked and worked all the time. She wanted to be the best Seagoing cowgirl there has ever been. Sometimes she would work more than she was soppost to. She enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. She went to alot of places. She went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as she was done with all the traveling she made nine trips all together! She made more trips than any Seagoing Cowgirl!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip she served her night as a watchman. She had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making her hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. She landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped her slide, that kept her from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for her she was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, she got her ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work she managed her time to have fun on board. She played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. She played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowgirl she thought of how amazing it feels to help people. She helped lots of people during her trips. So Luke had a great idea. She wanted people to help other people. She started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. But most of people thought she was crazy. She told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called her job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought she was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. But She didn't give up on her job though. She liked her job the way it is and she wouldn't change it for anything. She got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in her job.","

M-F15,"In the passage it states that she says that it is an amazing trip fro a small town girl. She is trying to tell girls that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowgirl. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowgirl. What she is saying is that she is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story she states that she went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. She says that she could go to China, and Europe on her extra time, and that she enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that she helped around the house as a young girl, and that helped her grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. She also states that she was a night watchmen, and she checked the animals every hour.

She also says that one night she was sliding downa latter on her back side and almost fell off the ship. All though she couldn't work for a few days, she satses that she was very thankful to be alive.

She states that she also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. she would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowgirl would be a good idea for young girls for somthing to do for a while.","

M-F18,"There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. If you read the passege, Luke says her life was changed and she had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities she visted. Some of things she visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things she did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things she did on board. She had to get water for the horses and feed them. She also had to be a nightwatch women.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowgirls is not a bad idea. She says that it changed her life and she got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because she did the program her decendents loved to help people and poor countrys. ","

M-F19,"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what she thinks about what she is doing,what she thinks about her friends, and what she thinks of helping others. But I bet she would think nice things about helping people because she saide that she liked the job. And when her friend asked her if she wanted to go with her she said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it she didnt want to miss. She also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and she also liked the journey geting to Europe with her friend. Plus we would of know what she thought about the journey,the place she was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what she thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what she thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how she felt when she craked her ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that she had with her new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what she felt and thought of it. Did she like it or not. And how about her family we would of know what she thought of them. Of course she would say good things about them but still we would of know more about her thoughts and feelings.

She wanted to jion the army service and help out so the told her to say in what she was doing and that she was on bored with the army. She helped take horses to greece on ship and that is hard to do with 335 horses on bored the ship,and she had to take care of them by feeding them,getting the poop up and out of there cage. When she was helping one night she almost fell off bored the ship and went into the dark Atlantic but lukly there was a melt bar that stopped she from falling off the edge of the ship.

When the horses got off the ship the women could play basketball,volleball,and table tennis with all the women on bored.

She started in 1945 with her friend from high school .When she left the army in 1947 she was glad to do all those things she had done to help all those people in need. She was als hapy that she got to travel to all the places she had always wanted to go to in the world to help people she didn't know that was in need that she got to know as a friend.

When she was done she went back home and did something new with her life again to see what she could learn about then.

Luke wanted to help those in need so she signed up. She said, ""Besides helping people, I had to see the side benefit of seeing Europe and China, but seeing Acropolis in Greece was special."" She didn't just want to help people she wanted the chance to see all those places she could see and when she join in the Seagoing Cowgirls she had the chance. She maybe thought it was all just helping people but she had the chance to see different places she had never been to. She also took care of the animals. She said they had to be fed and they kept her busy so she never had time to sit around and do nothing!

There you have it all the good things about joining in the Seagoing Cowgirls. Well hopefully you woud want to join the Seagoing Cowgirls!","

M-F24,"Luke is telling people to join. She wants more people. Luke is convincing people to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. She would see and adventure other places.

Another detail about Luke convincing people is to help her go to other places.

When she was going to graduate, soon her life would change. When it was 1945, they saw their seaman's paper. They headed to Greece. When luke turned 18. She could be draft to the military service. By the time she was dischared in 1947, Luke had made nine trips.

Another reason Luke would let you join is she would let u travel with her. It will be a good opportunity. She led international students and exchange visitors for many years. She said it might be difficult for her. It took her time to do everything. she had to check the animals for one hour. She was so tierd. On one night she was a night watchman. Luke had alot of bad days. She had to clean the ship. She was busy the whole time but she was ok because she had food to eat. it was fun for her.

Luke was a kind and brave person. She was really cool. I think she convinced a lot of people to join. It was really hard for her. She had to work and do stuff. She is a nice gal.","

M-F25,"Being a Seagoing Cowgirl let Luke see all over the world and help people in need. She had the most fun on her home with the other Seagoing Cowgirls. They would play Base baseball and volleyball in the empty hold of the animals been housed. They would aslo play table-tennis touranments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. When she turned 18 she wsa her way to Greece (as a Seagoing Cowgirl) and she got draft. When they found out she was a Seagoing Cowgirl they said she could do her service as a Seagoing Cowgirl.

It opend up the world to her. She got to see the Acropolis in Greece and she rode up in Venic, Italy were the streets are water. Helping out on her Aunt's farm helped her for the hard work as a Seagoign Cowgirl but it didn't help for the danger of the sea. It made her more awar of peole in other countries that need help and that stayed with her for life and she shared that wiht her family. She always said it was more than just an adventure.

Being a Seagoing Cowgirl can be fun at times but can be realy hard at some parts. It helps for life like school does. I think that more peole sould get a try to become a Seagoing Cowgirl just to learn soem of the same thing Luck did or see the things she might have seen. So give it a try it can be fun! ","

Even though she got hungry and tired she didn't quit. She discovered unique places in the world and meet other people.

Luke helped people that are in the war and people that does'nt have food, water, and shelter. She would want other women to join the war because it made her feel good about hiself because she repected her country. Luke didn't even think if she wants to be a a military she just said yes because she knew that it would be a oppurtunity of a lifetime.

I think that people should join war, so that we could have our freedom by getting it ourselves, by fighting in war and being courageous like Luke. Luke can inspire people and wanting themselves to join the military. Most military says that ""We die with honor"".    ","

She also said it is an opportunity of a lifetime to be a seagoing. She is saying you should join the seagoings, becouse it is very nice to go to places all the way from the other side of the U.S.

She's also saying if you like taking care of animals then you should join. She talks about how her ant and her worked on a farm so that helped her out of taking care of animals, but then she says that it did not help her with the dangers of the sea. She also talks about how she gets she's ribs broken. She also says that you work for them you sometimes have to check on the animals hourly.

She tells you that her friend tolled her that she should work there, so she could not say no, because she knew it would be a life time opportunity. She tells you she would find her self having fun on borad, especially on the return trips after they droped off the anamals. She says she play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. They also played table-tennis touraments, fencing, boxing, reading. whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

She said being a seagoing was more then just an adventure. She said it open the world up for her. She said she was happy to help people by giving them animals and food. She said that she was prepared for the hard work. She also talks about how she all most falls in to the dark Atlantic. She says on she 2ed trip she was a night wachman wich means yous have to cheak on the animals every hour.

She tells you how long it toke to get to a few places. It toke about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and it toke about a mouth to get to China. Caring for the animals kept Luke busy over travling. That's how Luke is trying to convincing you to be a seagoing.","

M-F32,"In this essay I will be writing a detailed argrument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowgirls progam. Soon after her high school graduation, her friend invited her to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with her friend after she realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but she learned about all hard work on her aunt Katie's farm. This all changed her life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to her first trip for Greece. While she is there she finds beautiful landmarks such as when she saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. She had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where she and the cowgirls played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowgirls got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made her appreciate her life more. She has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of her overseas trips have taught her her value and how luck she is. The ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" was more to her than an aventure. It was a life lesson.","

M-F36,"Luke was going to China, because her friend asked her and she said she couldn't pass this up. In the text it says that Luke had no idea that her life would change once she graduated high school. She was working two part time jobs. She knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. the United Nations Relief and rehabiliation Administartion hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the Mule that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When she finally got there she helped on her Aunt Katie's farm. She went on a second trip. The cowgirls all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowgirls. The cowgirl, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead her family to hostess a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet her family was very proud of her. When she turned 18 I bet she was excited because she could be drafted for miltary service. Then when her board learned that she was on a cattle boat trip they told her to just keep doing that for service.

The reason you should join the Military is because you could save a life. Several of lives. Also because we probably need more people because we could always use more people to protect us. Luke made nine trips after 1947.    ","

M-F39,"In the article Luke was asked by her freind don to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so when she said yes that would change her life. So then now she has been on nine trips since the first ever trip that she has taken. Luke was always busy tending the cattle during the day. She was having lots of fun even when she got knocked over the boat and broken her ribs. She was playing board games and everything like that to keep her busy while she was healing.

The reason of Luke going on trips across the oceans because she likes it and she was born to do it. Also her freind asked Luke to come with her to keep her company during the trips. Luke was waiting for some thing to drastically change her life and she to her wish off the drastic change. Luke would stop going with don if Luke didn't like the motion sickness,or because there where a lot of storms,or she didn't like tending the cows during the long and tiring journey. If the possibility was that Luke didn't like the sea her freind would be like are you ok and or something like that.

In conclusion Luke loves the sea and she wants to keep going out and adventuring the wild and the unknown. Luke couldn't say no because it was her freind don and she wanted to explore another island. Luke loves the same because she likes tending the cows and she likes her fellow crew mates that are with her on her journeys to the out and the open sea. Another reason that is because she wants to be in dangerous storms and worlpools. Luke want to take the risks in the dangerous sea.","

M-F40,"The author supported her ideas very well by explaning how ""venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". She explains how ""venus is often referred to as earths ""twin"""" and the author also explains how ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one compelling idea"".

I believe she did pretty good at explainng how venus is good in some ways and then how venus is bad. She didnt just focus on one thing she focused on it all and she put her paragraph in a very good lined up maner thats how everyone should put together their essays. The ending was the best part on how she restated the question that she had at the begining by just puting together a couple paragraphs she learnd a thing or two about venus.

So to finish off my paragraph I thought that she explained both bad and good thing about venus. She sounded like she knew exactly what she was talking about and she knew everything about it all. So that just makes this whole paragraph worthy.   ","

In this passage a Cowgirl who rode the waves Luke was a seagoing cowgirl. Luke Bomberger is her full name. There are many reasons why Luke Bomberger join the program to participate in the seagoing Cowgirls. Luke was a awesome seagoing cowgirl.

My first reson i think Luke join the program was because she got to take trips to alot of countrys to help animals. Luke thought it was fun being a segoing cowgirl. Luke also found time yo have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another reason she join the program, because she knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Luke help other countrys with thier needs and to provide food.

My second reason why she wanted to be a seagoing cowgirl is because she wanted to help countrys animals, and be a great woman. Luke claims that the cattle boat trips were an unbelievalbe opportunity for a small-town girl"", she says. Besides helping people Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.

My third and final reason is she made about 16 times she crossed the Alantic ocean,and pacific ocean twice.

Don Resit is her name she invited Luke to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It took them some time to take tips.

She fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.

She was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day she was doing her normal rutien, and she had slid down a slippery ladder an her backside and when she slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped her slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean. Helping on her aunt Katie's farm when she was young had prepared luke for hard work.

M-F56,"Luke wanted to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program because she knew it would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When Luke went she would be helping horses, young cows, and mules being shipped over seas to a new locatation she had to help gather suplies, animals and many other things supplies to help out things that had gone wrong also 44 nations joined together to help them out.

In one of Luke's trips there had been more then 335 plus enough hay to feed all of them. By time Luke had turned 18 she had arrived in Greece which meant she could go into the military service. When Luke had been discharged she had maken more then nine trips, that is the most any Seagoing Cowgirl has ever gone in this service. It took the Seagoing Cowgirls two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the United States, and on top of it took them a month to get to China.

When Luke was younger she used to help out on her Aunt Katie's farm, this helped her to learn her hardworking skills but never trained her for the dangers at sea. She had decided that helping out in the Seagoing Cowgirls and all of the animals, and food services was worth all the help that her and her pals had given. It was real rainy one night after making her hourly check up on the horses to report to the captain when she had slipped down a slippery ladder ship cracking some of her ribs so then she couldn't do her job for a couple of days.

Luke also had a lot of fun on board with all of her friends. When the animals had been unloaded they played baseball, volleyball, fencing, table tennis and a lot more sports and game. Luke said that being a Seagoing Cowgirl was way much more then an adventure she had opened up the world for Luke. She was very grateful for her jouney, it mad her more aware of the other countries and there needs.

Luke had learned everything from helping out animals to teamwork. Luke thought seen that helping other countries is fun but you do have to learn teamwork and much more. When she had broken some of her ribs she had to stop working her job for a while. When she got back on the job she was feeling very happy for what she had just accomplished for the world. ","

M-F62,"When Luke was a little town girl she made a huge inprovment by becoming a

Seagoing Cowgirl. She saw a lot of stuff on the boat as you can tell on paragraph 5 she said, ""Besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be a great experince for a small town girl. I think it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. If her friend had not been there to tell her about it she would have been working two jobs her whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.

Luke is also the best there because she has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what she saw during the trip and what she did. She loves to help people by this job she has helped bring all the cattle/food. Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. She worked so much she got hurt and craked her ribs. She was happy to be alive. Therefore she had to stay at home to get better.

Luke's point of view would also tell how fun it was to work there and she would convince you that it is a realy good job. She was very happy to get this job beause she said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Luke created history and when she could not do the job any more people visited her all the time like students and many familys to live on all the history she made. It opened up Lukes world up when she got the job. Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away. Its amazing how she can get all those animals and pick them up on the boat and take them across the country and drop them off. She was realy good at her job to do that! That is how Luke Bomberger made history in America.","

M-F65,"You should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program! You should join it because you get to help others and animals. Also it not just a plus for them it is one for you too. The plus is that when you travel to help others you get to see the ocens all the time and beautiful sights! It is an opportunity of a lifetime if you ask me! If I was old enough I might what to think about being a Seagoing Cowgirl!

Luke's claim was a great claim! Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank she became a Seagoing Cowgirl! Even herself she said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' She helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. She recovered their food supplies. She went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see.

When you are a Seagoing Cowgirl you have a responsibility to help animals and more! But it can also be dangerous crossing the oceans all the time. If you want to be a Seagoing cowgirl you have to be brave and courageous! You need those traites because if that was your job you would'nt want to be nervous or afraid all the time.

Luke had too be brave she had to have a great outlook to kept doing what she was doing, And you can too! Her point of veiw was strong. She went on 9 trips and that is the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl! She also had a cargo of 355 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them! She even cracked her ribs, but she is ok. Over something small but she was brave enough to keep going because she cared for the animals and she loved her job.

You should become a Seagoing Cowgirl for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowgirls! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowgirls! She even know herself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.                                    ","

M-F70,"Luke's point of view in this story is telling people that whatever something or someone is giving you the chance to do, do it. You never know what could happen after. She was exicted to go on the Seagoing Cowgirls program. Once she did go she already took nine trips. If she didn't like going back and forth she would have been part of the program. This is telling you that you would likely like the Seagoing Cowgirls program after all. If Luke point of view can see it, you can see it.

The Seagoing Cowgirls program is to help take care of the rhorses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke wanted to help so she signed up, like you should. She's point of view tells you that she was happy she signed up and doesn't regret it so im pretty sure you wouldnt either. Let this be a way for you to see that you should sign up. ","

M-F71,"Have you ever read the story A Cowgirl who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a girl who is invited to Europe and she becomes a Seagoing Cowgirl after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowgirl, the Seagoing Cowgirl has to take care of animals on a ship and a girl named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowgirl, a Seagoing Cowgirl is a Cowgirl who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowgirl in the story was no different she took go care of the animals. Everyday she watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowgirl she knew it was going to be alot of hard work so she worked as hard as she could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and she explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowgirl I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowgirl,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowgirl is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to her. And in Luke's own words she said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowgirl can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, she slipped on a ladder and cracked her ribs but thankfully she didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of her side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

Now you know how the Seagoing Cowgirls worked, how they took care of animals and how Luke explored. Now, if you want to achieve something like Luke did then get out there and show everyone that you can do what you dream to do.","

M-F72,"Why should luke join this program? Luke should join the program because its a opportunity of a lifetime. Plus, she gets to spend time with her friend. Lastly she will experence new things. Its a good thing she went on with going to do the program cause it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

This program will be a opportunity of a lifetime. In the prompt it states that she couldn't say no to her friend, and that she knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Secondly Luke says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small-town girl."" Besides helping others she likes to taking water rides Venice, Italy. Thrirdly Luke was able to tour excavated castle in Crete and Marveled. But mostly went there to spend time with her friend.

Luke didn't go to the program she went there to see her friend. First she gets a phone call from her friend saying ""Hey would you like to come over to Europe then asked about cattle boating. Her friend Don Reist confnced her to come out and see her, but not only see her but to go cattle boating with her. But yet not only did Luke do the program and gets to hang out with her friends she gets to experence new thngs.

Luke was able to experence new things while on this trip, and learn some to. World war 2 was over in 1945. Luke was a watchman and she had to check on the animals every hour. Luke found time to have fun the cowgirls would play volleyball, baseball, table tennis, and more.

In conclusion, I think Luke choose the right chose because she would still be doing the same thing being a cowgirl and farming. Since she went cattle boating she's not the same in a good way. Also it was good to go see her friend and cattle boat with her to. These are my reasons why Luke should join.   ","

M-F74,"Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was one of the best times of Luke's life. She got to travel the world and explore. And she got to help people around the world.

Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before she made it to Greece. This meant she was able to be drafted for military service, but her draft board said that she should just keep the service she already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but she had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl. Not only did Luke help people, but she also got to see Europe and China.

So Luke and Dan helped all of the animals and got the better. Luke was happy because she also got to see the Acropolis in

Greece and she also got to take a gondola ride in Venice.

When luke ws almost arriving in Greece she turned 18 which meant she could be drafted in the military services. When Luke's draft board learned that she was on a cattle-boat trip they said why don't you just keep doing that for her service.When Luke was part of the cattle-boat trip it was an unbelievable opportunity for someone like her. She said ""besides helping people she got to see Europe and China. The exciting part was that she got to go to Greece and see the Acropolis and go on the gondola ride in Venice.

Luke got a job as a night watchman. Her job was to check on the animals at night time. When she had the job as a night watchmen she slid down the slippery slide on her backside and cracked some of her ribs so she couldn't do her job for a couple of days. Luke said ""it made her more aware of

Luke Bomberger wanted people to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program

because you help young cows, and mule that were shopped overseas. So Luke and her friend Dan signed up for the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

Luke and her friend Dan got their orders received so they can report to New Orleans. So after that they boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster they were headed to Greece. They had 335 horses and alot of hay and ats to feed them on the way to Greece. Luke and her friend Dan wanted to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program because they could help all the animals that were shipped overseas and that were hurt. So Luke and Dan helped all of the animals and got the better. Luke was happy because she also got to see the Acropolis in

Greece and she also got to take a gondola ride in Venice.

When luke ws almost arriving in Greece she turned 18 which meant she could be drafted in the military services. When Luke's draft board learned that she was on a cattle-boat trip they said why don't you just keep doing that for her service.When Luke was part of the cattle-boat trip it was an unbelievable opportunity for someone like her. She said ""besides helping people she got to see Europe and China. The exciting part was that she got to go to Greece and see the Acropolis and go on the gondola ride in Venice.

Luke got a job as a night watchman. Her job was to check on the animals at night time. When she had the job as a night watchmen she slid down the slippery slide on her backside and cracked some of her ribs so she couldn't do her job for a couple of days. Luke said ""it made her more aware of

people of other countries and their needs.]""

M-F78,"Luke Bomberger wouldn't have seen how fun life was if she didnt graduate highschool. She had a good life and even better when her freind Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Right when they started to leave to europe world war 2 ended. They had arrived August 14 the day the pacific war ended.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means she could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was her job. It was no big deal though when she was a little kid her aunt made her work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case she did work in a farm in future and look she is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip she was a night watchman. All she had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowgirl it was more than she ever wanted. She had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. She was very scared when she almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved her life. Luke would find some time to have her own time and talked to the animals.","

M-F81,"Today we will be talking about the story ""A Cowgirl Who Rode the Waves."" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young woman on her way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say she did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why she did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for herself. No she did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why she did it to help those women, women, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as she knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were she may have to work but has fun in between her hard work. Like when in italy she visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when she fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of her ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding her in.

For a second lets talk about the time she spent overseas. We look at the fun she had in her nine adventures. Such as when she first visted Greece. She went to the Acropolis, soon after she visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that she got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that she tried to help people. She was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop her form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe her charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call her this and simply this human.","

M-F84,"Would you like to travel like Luke had traveled to and by cities.Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more for Luke Bomberger.Her deamnor had changed since she became a Seagoing Cowgirl.She was like a kid in a candy store,for the first when she got to see all the different countries.Then the animals were happier than a dog being scrachted on the belly when they got food or water,thanks to Luke and the workers.But Luke can be gregarious around the animals since she was a nice gal.When ever she to a nice place she thought oh-my-gosh-that is-so-pretty.

Luke also had fun on board,especially on return trips after animals had been unloaded.In the empty holds where the animals would be.They would play games to pass time.When would play games that are inncouius it would just be to pass time.Some of the Seagoing Cowgirls maybe

a little zealous at times.During the games people can be exited over fencing like a professinal.

On her trip,Luke served as a night watchman.So someone can keep watch over the deck of the ship,and below the deck of the ship.She does this so all the supplies and cargo doesn't get damaged or gets hurt.She likes being a Seagoing

Cowgirl becauis she gets to travel ever where.Then see animals like she is use to helping out.","

M-F85,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowgirls program to teach what Luke does when she is a seagoing cowgirl.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when she is a seagoing cowgirl she ahd to take care of animals when she was a seagoing cowgirl, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and her friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowgirl. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because she is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowgirl because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowgirl. Luke showed that she wanted to help others and animals as she would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China. I think she liked China as the best tour that she probably been on before, because she talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that she had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowgirl that was showed in the passage. And she loves that she is doing in the passage i think, she likes caring for other animals that were in the passage that it was stated in the passage.      ","

M-F86,"From Luke's experieance she know's that she is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at her home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with her for the rest of her days. Like she said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day her friend Don Reist came along and asked her to be a ""Seagoing Cowgirl"" with her. She knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly she went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowgirls were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and her friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. She was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that she was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One her way she got to see ols castles. She also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over her nine missions she learned that she was very lucky. LIke she said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with her, she became a hostess for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever! We are very lucky to live in the USA becuase we have many more oppertunities the anyone else does.      ","

M-F97,"Luke bomberger had an interesting story to tell about her adventures on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. She saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such she would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowgirls.

Luke starts her story as a young girl [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when her friend Don Reist invited her to work on a cattle boat with her. She accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such she was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for her servince so she spent another two years working on the boat. She says that she helped alot of people in China and Europe but she also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. She says that aside from her adventures she learned of how lucky she is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries she visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the women on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The women also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the women also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than ""Best job ever."" ","

M-F99,"Luke was a sea cowgirl she described every thing wonderful and great but is she just saying that to bring more people in the business .

My first reason that shows that Luke is maybe trying to bring more people to work with her is that in the whole script she only comes across one problem but everything else is great which is hard to believe because in the sea there could be storms ,waves,floods or leaks on the boat but surprisingly she never comes across any of those problems which is odd.

My second reason that shows that Luke is just trying to bring people into the business is in the text it said that Luke kept on saying that she got to ride gondola in the streets of water in Spain,and got to excavate a castle in create , and even got to see the Panama Canal on her way to China so she is basically saying that all of the things she did where fun she got to go siht seeing but not everything she did could of been fun she also had to feed animals and clean stables so not every thing she did was fun.

In conclusion these reasons show Luke maybe is liens but maybe she is telling the truth its up to you to choose a side is she lying or not so maybe just maybe she could be telling the truth.","

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowgirl is sometimes dangerous, but fun most of the time. The Seagoing Cowgirl program is fun you should try it. ]""

M-F101,"People should join the program because the Seaagoing cobows are trying to fight the country and end WW2. But after the war you could do fun things. Luke's inventor was fun because she got to travel.

Luke's claim is its alright to be Seagoing Cowgirl is fun but sometimes it just feels good to be still alive after the war. Seagoing cowgirls are trying to help other people to get food so they can survive.

The Sea going Cowgirls are good for the world because they save people's life.

Luke had made 9 trips over the world and the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl. Sea going Cowgirls ride on cattle-boat so they can go around the world. The Seagoing Cowgirls help 44 nations to joind together to make the UNRRA.

My conclusion is people should join the Seagoing Cowgirls because they help people and 44 nation joind together to make the UNRRA.The Seagoing Cowgirls ended WW2 and they traveled 9 trips with cattle-boat to get around. Luke is a good Seagoing Cowgirl because she helps her aunt Katies farmas a girl. But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was muc more o an aventure for Luke Bomberger.

M-F103,Well in the Seagoing Cowgirls program i think people and plus they get to travel on a boat. Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time girl just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well she. She was supposed to check on the animals every hour she was going to cheack on theam when she flew and she broke her ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger she said she is grateful for this opportunity. It made her be more aware of people. She hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell her about her job.,"

M-F104,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and her friend invited her to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. She knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So she went.

You could see how she was feeling just by the way the author put it. She was exicited and she was ready. When Luke found out that she was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules she knew she would be good at it because she worked at her aunts farm. She thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

She had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when she broke her ribs during a storm. She took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for her because she was a small - town girl. She also knew she was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. She had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young girl.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help. Thats why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program. Luke was brave enough to do this kind of thing just because of 1 thing, she had faith in her, her best friend, and the people. Im pretty sure your going to have a warm welcoming home surprise waiting for you at your place. Im entirely sure that all of you want that surprise. Just join the Seagoing Cowgirls program and your garenteed and fun active time with the people you are working with and the peoeple that need your help. So have the faith Luke had, and come on down and sign up for Seagoing Cowgirls program. Hope to see you there cowgirl.

Oh and one more thing, have some faith in yourself, it always turns out good. Just ask Luke Bomberger, she will tell you about all that happen just with a lot of faith and courage.","

M-F105,"It could be a opportunity of a lifetime to travel over sea's and be a Seagoing cowgirl. It can lead your family to hostess a number of international student to help educate them in learning like school for them. You can help people with their needs and other countries that suffer without food or water. Being a Seagoing cowgirl can lead to many different adventures in life.

Luke said for being a Seagoing Cowgirl she lead her family to hostess lots of international students and exchange visitors for many years. She overthought about going too but she just couldn't just skip this opportunity of a lifetime. She also didn't know her life would change really quick right after high school graduation. World War II was over in Europe and many countries were left in pieces.

Luke was very suprised about going over sea's.

It took her about two weeks for her to cross the Alantic ocean. It also took her a month to get to China because she was so far away from China. She has helped out her Aunt Katie's farm as a girl. Which had made her brave enough to cross the oceans just her and some other people on board of the ship or boat.

That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowgirls. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did she fell and sliped up she ended up being fine.","

M-F106,"Luke is trying to convice people to be in the Seagoing Cowgirls program by saying cool things that she does. For example: she is saying that she toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to china. She also said that she finds time to have fun on board. some games they played were baseball, vollyball, Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Luke got to vist different places and she got to go to 16 different places. Luke also got to go to the Atlantic Ocean. Luke also liked to see the animals. She would always go visit the animals and feed them. Another thing luke would do is help people that got hurt during the War.

So those are a lot of fun things that luke did. She also did a lot of good things. Like feed animals, take them from one place to another, and help people that got hurt in the War.

Luke shared all those fun and good things that she did to convice others to participate the Seagoing Cowgirls program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ]""

M-F108,"A good reason to join the program was that the cattle-boat trips were an unbielievable opportunity for a small town girl. It was because besides helping people you get to see lots of stuff while in the process of doing these things like Europe and China.

Luke turned 18, she was old enough to be drafted into the military when Luke draft board learned that she was on cattle-boat trip, they told her to just keep doing that for her service. By the time she was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips and that was the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl.

Luke got to explore the world, also found time to have fun aboard after they got all the animals out, they played stuff like Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and those games helped pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to her because she says that she's grateful for the opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowgirl.

As she speaks she says it made her more aware of people of other countries and their expectations. That awareness stayed with her,leading her family to hostess a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.   ","

M-F111,"The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies,animals and more.

They hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and her friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,she got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

She also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on her aunt Katie's farm as a girl prepared her for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on her second trip luke served as a watchman.

Her job was to check on all of the animals every hour.

One time she said she slipped and fell on her backside and her heart raced as she shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,thankfully a sharp peice of metal stopped her slide,or she would have flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

She was happy to be alive,but she could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board,especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded,the cowgirls played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

In conclusion, she feels that being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure. Luke quotes,""I'm grateful for the oppurtunity,""she says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Lukes example of being a ""Seagoing Cowgirl"" shows how you today how,by being on a boat,can make a difference.                     ","

M-F113,"The author's points seem to come to one conclusion, and that is that we should explore Venus despite the risks. She supports this idea with many different examples and reasons.

One example of her supporting her idea is in paragraph 6. She says that the only way scientist can understand Venus is by taking a risk and to think of it as a challenge. This supports her claim because hes saying to take a risk and explore Venus, despite the obstacles. Another thing she seems to push alot as a reason we should explore Venus is that we just don't have alot of knowledge about it. An example of this is in paragraph 2, when she said not a single space space craft has landed on venus in over three decades.

Another way she supports her idea is in paragraph 8. She says that striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value. This really supports her idea because she's saying that exploring Venus is worth something. She also says space exploration shouldn't be limited by dangers and doubt, which would imply that she supports exploring Venus.

The author supports her idea that we should explore Venus more despite the risks well with many different reasons. Like how we have almost no knowledge about it. Or how we should take the risks as challenges and try to overcome them. In the end she supports her idea well and backs it up with valid claims.            ","

In paragraph 1 it says Luke's friend Don Reist invited Luke to go with her to the Seagoing Cowgirl program and Luke did not turn the offer down because that was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In paragraph 4 it said that

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment she could be drafted for military service.

""When my drafy board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

By the time she was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl.

In paragraph 5 there were some reasons she should join the Seagoing Cowgirls, and it said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town girl,"" she says.

""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""

she says. ""So was taking a Gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

In paragraph 7 the way Luke's claim supported the outcome of the story.

Helping out on her aunt Katie's farm as a girl had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

On her second trip, Luke served as night watchman.

Her job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making her hourly report to the captain, she slid down a slippery ladder on her backside.

Luke's heart raced as she shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped her slide, keeping her from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

She was happy to be alive.

But she could not work for a couple days because of cracked ribs.

My conclusion of the story is in paragraph 9 when it says, But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to her.

""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" she says.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

And that awareness stayed with her, leading her family to hostess a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.","

M-F115,"The program called Seagoing Cowgirls will allow you to experience adventure and vist many unique places. The reason I think this is because she gets to deal with horses every day, which I would love to do that, and when she stops she gets to travel around the cities.

Luke says she gets to care for the animals while she´s crossing oceans. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalles had to be cleand too.

She says she got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. ¨But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,¨ she says. ¨So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.¨ Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

This proves to me that the Seagoing Cowgirls program trip would be fun. Please consiter this idea.             ","

M-F117,"Luke really enjoyed the Seagoing Cowgirls program. If you like helping people or takeing care of things thin this is the job for you. The Seagoing Cowgirls helped take care of cows,hores, and mules that where over seas. Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece, that ment she could sing up for miliary service. She was on her cattle-boat trip when she signe u for the miliary. They had plenty of food and water to feed the anmials and themselves.

When you are a Seagoing Cowgirl you get to travel a lot of places. Luck had been on 19 trips before they discharged her in 1947. If you like traveling then this is for you. They went all the way to China and it took them one whole month. They went to a lot of different places. Luck though all of her trips where very special.

Luck had come a long way since she was a kid. Luck grew up in in the country. She helped her aunt Katie out on the farm. She didn't have the best life when she was a kid. When Luke became a Seagoing Cowgirl it opened up the world for her.

When Luke was a Seagoing Cowgirl it was much more than an advernture even though she did travel a lot. Luke was very greatful for the opportunity. Luke saw that other countries don't have a lot of stuff like we do. She saw that they where in need. That awareness stayed with her almost her whole life.

Luke didn't just work she had a lot of fun on board. They played a lot of games like fencing, boxing, table-tennis tournaments, games, reading, and whittling made the time go by pretty quick. It was a lot easier to play the games when the animals where unloaded.

She sometimes went to places where war had just ended to help them in need. They also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty spaces where the animals usest to be.

Luke was a very kind harted person. She never though about just herself. She would go back and do it all over again. Luke was a very thoughful person. Tell me would you ever be a Seagoing Cowgirl.         ","

M-F119,"The seagoing cowgirl's sounds like a great program.

You get to see new and diffrent things when your in it.

You also get to go on a long ship/ boat ride.

If i were a girl i'd love to do the seagoing cowgirl's program.

You may not but we all have our own opinion's.

She didn't only help herself she helped others.

Luke sounds happy and that's what most people want at least that's what i want, so if you like seeing new and bueatiful things you'll want to do this.

Luke didn't really have a choice. She had no idea that her life would change when she graduatated from high school.

She was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when her friend Don Reist invited her to go with her to Europe on a cattle boat. She couldn't say no, she knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke is intersting she didn't want her life to go where it was going but if you do the right and great things. The right and great things will come back to you.

And that is what happened to Luke she was doing the right thing and one or two will or did come right back.

They did have to fight for there country but it wasn't just there's it was for others also.

This was a very imformational artice about if you do the right thing it comes right back, and if you can also in this article it did.","

M-F121,"The Seagoing Cowgirls was part of a program called the UNRRA that helped rebuild cities after World War 11. The Cowgirls transported animals such as, horses, young cows, and mules overseas to the ruined cities. You should become a Seagoing Cowgirl.

Luke became a Seagoing Coyboy after her high school graduation. The reason she joined was because her freind Don invited her to go with her on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke didn't disagree because she knew it would be a opportunity of a lifetime.

If you were to join the Seagoing Cowgirls you would be a part of a very important program. 44 nations united to help the contries in ruins after World War 11. The Seagoing Cowgirls shipped the animals to help the countries regain their food supplies, animals and other things that the countries needed.

Being one of the Cowgirls didn't mean it was all work and no play. During the trips across the oceans you can see China, Greece, and other contries you've probaly never seen before. After a hard days work of cleannig stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table-tennis also kept the Cowgirls ocupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on her second trip. Her job was to check on the animals every hour. After she made her report to the captian she slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall twards the Atlantic. A piece of metal stopped her fall but she couldn't work because she cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowgirl. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowgirls you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of suprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others.","

After a hard days work of cleannig stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table-tennis also kept the Cowgirls ocupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on her second trip. Her job was to check on the animals every hour. After she made her report to the captian she slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall twards the Atlantic. A piece of metal stopped her fall but she couldn't work because she cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowgirl. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowgirls you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of suprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others.]""

M-F123,"Luke had no idea that her life would change so soon after her high school graduation. She was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when her friend Don invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowgirls to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time she was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,she says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to her. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,""she says. It made her more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion Luke had the best time of her life being a Seagoing Cowgirl she didn't no her life would change so soon after her high school graduation. In 1945 world war 2 made places get ruined so she decied to go to Seagoing Cowgirls. She help animals like horses,young cows,and mules too. She had so much to do but she did it and yes it was hard but she did what she was suppossed to do. A Seagoing Cow girl was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world up to her. She is gratefull of the opportunity.           ","

M-F125,"So when Luke came back to China she saw even more homeless people than before. So she thought she would have to make a change to that.

So when she was setting up a program for conviencing people to help the homeless Don tried to call and have her come to America and and Luke said, ""Don, I can't I have to help the people in China because I see little kids and grown people starving on the street and that hurts me."" So then when she had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help. So the applications to sign up there was a fee of ten dollars to help with the grocceries and that was why even more people did not join her.

So when she saw a lot of people without forms she stopped everybody and had a long speech about helping the poor and imagine if you were in their shoes and telling them they didn't want to be like that. So then almost all the people clapped and then walked in and got a form and asked her where to start. She said,"" Just if you see a homeless person, help her out. So then after she rode her boat to America and helped Don out she came back to China to see how her SeaGoing Cowgirls program was going.

When she came to China she was very happy of how everybody had a house and job and nobody was starving. So she set up a meeting and thanked everybody who supported that program and told them they did a wonderful job and she almost cired of how much she was happy.

So when she rode her boat back to her home town she told Don and Luke's family about what happened and they said they should do that in America and they did and it worked out just as great as China. Her program became national because how good it was and she said it was all the people who helped out she said, ""What I love about it was that they didn't have to do but how they did, it just makes me warm inside and very happy.""

Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But when Luke went to see the Acropoils in Greece she said it was specail. She also said that gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Luke also found fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

You can save people and animals. You can save the person if they are drowning by your boat or you can save an animals if they fall of your boat.

But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. Luke said it opended up the world to her she said she is grateful for the opportunity.

M-F128,"Why Luke Thinks You Should Join The

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowgirls program. I mean,why wouldn't she,she had a great time there and she thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story she even says that she knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like she knew it was going to be great experence for her and it could be a great experence for you.

Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that she is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowgirl and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

Luke liked Greece and the other places so much is in Greece she liked Acropolis. She liked the other places but Greece was her favorite. She also went on nine trips!

M-F136,"Luck Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Don Reist her friend invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

She said yes right then she knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke signed up with her friend Don.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant she could be drafted for military service.

When her draft board learned she was on a cattle-boat trip, they told her to keep doing that for her service.

By the time she was discharged in 1947, she had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, she had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept her busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on her aunt Katie's farm as a girl had prepared her for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

She couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to her.

She is grateful for the opportunity.

It made her more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The awarness stayed with her, leading her family to hostess a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.      ","

She couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to her.

She is grateful for the opportunity.

M-F137,"In the story ""A Cowgirl Who Rides the Waves"" a young adult named Luke signs up for a program that is called the ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" that take care of horses, young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowgirls do this because countries that were destroyed need them for travel and food. Now here are three reasons why Luke decided to join the Seagoing Cowgirls.

Luke signed up for the Seagoing Cowgirls because it was an opportunity of a life time. That means that she would not get anymore chances to travel on a boat around the world. This is also a big opportunity mostly because she is a farm girl from a small town. In paragraph 5 and 1 it states ""... Luke couldn't say no. She knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town girl, but besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China..."" Also Luke wanted to join because she got to help countries that were damaged from the war. In the two sentences that were right before the first paragraph (the ones that help explain the story a little bit) it states "" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II (or WWII for short).""

The last reason that Luke joined the Seagoing Cowgirls was because she got to be with animals. In paragraph 7 it states "" Helping out on her aunt Katie's farm had prepared Luke for the hard work..."" So that means that if she worked on a farm with a lot of animals, and she joins something with animals, that means she likes animals. Also in paragraph 1 it states "" ... Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat."" So that would mean that she wants to travel with animals in a baot or she wants to be in a boat filled with animals because she like animals (this story is kind of reminding me about Noah's Arch, you know the one with the boat filled with animals because there was a giant flood).

So those are the reasons why Luke desided to join the Seagoing Cowgirls. Remember she joined because she wanted to help countries that were damaged or destroyed in the World War II, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for her because she is a farm girl, and because she got to be with animals. That is why Luke joined the program.","

Luke did not know her life would change soon. It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many counties were left in the ruins. UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that wereshipped over seas. It says that Luke and Don signed up.

Luke said "" It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Then awareness stayed with her. The cowgirls played beseball and volleyball games on board when Luke was on. There was plenty of games they played on board.

Helping at her aunt Katie's farm as a girl had prepared her is what the paragrph said so what it is saying is when she was little then she went to her aunt Katie's farm and played around and it helped her with her future with animals.        ","

M-F139,"Luke was 18 years old. She just finished her high school graduation. Luke had two jobs working at a grocery store and at a bank, until her life cahnged.

Luke's friend Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. World War II just ended and a lot of countries needed help, so Luke and her friend started to help. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowgirls to take care of all of the animals that would be on the boat. Luke and Don then signed up.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town girl. Luke was happy that she was helping people but she was also really excited to see Europe and China. Luke also went to Venice, Italy and she even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

Helping out on her aunt Katie's farm as a girl really helped and prepared her for this hard work that she is doing today. Then soon enough, Luke got a new job on the boat. Luke's job was check on all the animals every hour.

Then one night Luke's life almost ended. Luke was going to go see the captain but she slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. Luke almost flew overboard but a metal along the edge stopped her.

Luke had fun on board also. The cowgirls would play volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

Luke was happy for what she has done. It made Luke more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness always stayed with her. Luke saved peoples lives. Luke is a heroine.","

Well if that did'ent convinc you than, hears something that might, Luke Bomberger her self said ""She found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had beeen unloaded.""The Cowgirls also played baseballand volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."" Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. When Luke and her friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of her self becaus she helped out her aunt Katie on her farm as a girl , but her chalang was the dangerous seas.

Now Luke was in her early 20s and she was on her second night of wachman job, that ment that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night ,she was making her hourly report to the captin. on her way down she sliped down aladder on her back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stoped her from falling into the dark, cold,tarorizing Atlantic.

She had crackend a couple of her ribs. In Lukes life time Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl.

Being Sea going Cowgirl is much more Than a great time its an opportunity for you it giving you achance to see the word, and it shows you how much we are given in are country than other people around the world.

That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Bomberger. After you do this you can tell stundents and others about what you did to help others ,and you might even make an impact on others. For being in her 20ntys Luke was a smart young woman for what she did.

So what chose are you going to make during your life , help ,or let animals die and people that need the food to servive and let them die to die?

Whats your chose?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ","

You would probably want to join because you get to help people affected by the World War II. You also ge to help out animals like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Who doesn't like that?

Many countries were left to ruins in Europe, so to help them the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowgirls to take care of things. It was a big opportunity! One of the Seagoing Cowgirls, Luke, said that she liked helping the animals on the ship. She loved taking care of the horses and young cows they had. She mentioned that she also enjoyed taking care of the people in need, it made her feel good! She also said she is really grateful she got to have the Oppurtunity of her lifetime!

If u would like to do any of these things I mentioned in this paragraph then being in the Seagoing Cowgirls program would be perfect for you. But these are only a few reasons why you could or wanted to join.","

M-F152,"Luke Bomberger had a friend who asked her to tour Europe with her, she knew she couldn't turn it down.

World War II had just been in Europe, but was now over. Many comturies were left in ruins. These contries needed animals and livestock to survive. The UNRRA hired seagoing cowgirls to take care of the livestock on the boats when they were being shipped to a certain part of the world to another. Luke and her friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowgirls program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant she could be drafted for the army. Her draft amnagement company had learned she was in the seagoing cowgirls, and they told her to keep doing what she was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, she got into a bad accident that left her without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the women upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

When Luke had quit the seagoing cowgirls, she had successfully completed nine trips, the most trips a seagoing cowgirl has ever done, delivering animals to people in need of them.","

M-F153,"In this article the author tells us about Venus. She tells us that it is called the ¨Evening Star¨, that it is known as Earths ¨twin¨, and then she explains the attempts made to study and learn more about the planet. She also explains how those attempts were unsucsessful and that the planet is dangerous. But, despite the dangers she has presented to us, she explains that it is worth the danger. I dont personaly believe she did the best job explaining why she believed so and she definitly did not convince me to think the same.

The author never truely explained her claim that she thought exploring Venus was worth the risks and complications. For most of the artical she rambles on telling us about and explaining what was already found out about the planet. She never gave reasoning for believing we sould follow threw with trying to learn more about the planet. She only breifly told us her claim in the last paragraph, paragraph 8. It reads, ¨Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.¨ She tells us that all we will get from risking our lifes is insite on a dangerous planet that we may not even have use for, and she states that we will be faced with more and or equally intimidating endeavors. It may just be my opinion but that does not seem like very convincing or valid reasons for putting lifes in danger.

I truely believe that the author of the artical, ¨The challenge of Exploring Venus¨ did not support her claim and what she believed very well let alone at all. All she gives us is two reasons that are not very valid and did not back them up or tell us why those reasons make a good point and sould make us think the same way. She did not tell us why we needed the information so badly that we should risk our lifes or even make the effort. I do not belive the author supported the idea or really stated her claim or what she belived. She needs more reasoning and explaining of what we would gain from this and how it would benifit us. She also would need more supporting details of what we need the information for and why.","

M-F157,"Luke was had just graduated High School and had 2 part time jobs. One day Don, Luke's friend came to ask Luke if she wanted to travel on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. Luke had said yes and at that moment she had just began an amazing adventure.

Luke had a very good experience that might have inspired the reader to do the same things. Luke was not only traveling in a boat to Europe but, she was also helping people get back to good shape because, world war 2 had just ended leaving them in bad shape. Students should be inspired because, Luke was helping people get back in good shape. People might also convinced to do the same thing Luke did.

Luke was having a lot of fun traveling around the world on a cattle ship. Luke knew this was an amazing opportunity in her life. Lukke herself had said that this was an amazing opportunity for a small town girl. She saw so many amazing things in the places she went. Luke had mentioned that she had been to Europe, China and Greece.

As Luke was on that cattle ship, she was helping people around the world get back to good shape, she was helping society. She was also bonding with animals, she was taking good care of animals. Most importantly it seemed like Luke was learning about the world and animals on this experience. Luke was experiencing how hard work felt. Luke, was really busy as they were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. She had to care of the animals by, feeding them, also giving them water and cleaning their stalls.

On her 2nd trip though she did have a diffcult time because, on a rainy night Luke was put as a watchman. She was supposed to check on the animals every hour. She had slipped down the ladder and got hurt. Because she couldn't work for a while, Luke found some ways to have fun on the ship. She and her friends played baseball and volleyball where the animals had stayed. After Luke had been discharged in 1947, Luke had made 9 trips(the most out of all seagoing cowgirls!)

Luke knew from the very beginning that this travel was the very beginning of an amazing adventure. Luke had learned alot over her travel. She had been to so many amazing places.She had been part of an amazing adventure to help people, that might have inspired\convinced to do the same thing.","

M-F159,"Luke Bomberger used to be an average teenager working two part-time jobs. Then her friend, Don Reist, came and asked her if she wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowgirl', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.

The Seagoing Cowgirls are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowgirls, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.

The Seagoing Cowgirls were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what she was doing was a great cause, but did she know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that she was taking, but she wasn't doing it for herself, she was doing it for the people that needed her help.        ","

M-F160,"The author claims that studying Venus is worthy despite the many dangers. Throught the whole passage the author gives pros and cons about exploring Venus. She mentions facts that are good and bad about the planet, and trys to convince the reader that this idea to explore the planet, despite its dangers, is good.

In the first paragraph the author is trying to pull the readers attention in. She gives examples about Venus and explaines why she thinks it is worth being explored. The author states little facts about the planet, but is careful not to mention its dangerouse factors yet. She simple states that another name for Venus is the evening star. She also goes on to say that Venus is the second planet to the sun, and continues with these simpe facts.

As the author moves on through the story she starts to explain more of the cons of exploring this planet. She says that the temperature is well over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit and aslo that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we epxerience on Earth.

By telling the reader this information she is proving that even though she is listing all the dangers of doing this and exploring the planet, that she is going to convince you that this is worth exploring. The author goes on to say how powerful this planet is by saying that we have sent space crafts to Venus before and it hasen't lasted more than a couple of minutes, so why would we bother sending a human. She then explains what technolgy that we would be using to make this happen. She says that the computers we have now coulden't work because they are to delicate and can break easily. However we have very old computers avalible to us. The computers that helped us in World War two in the 1940s. She goes on to explain how her would work. At the end she says how she knows that this will be hard but that our travel on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but that we should explore these dangers.

I feel that the author did a very nice job. She stated what the problem was. She then continued to go on and explain the pros and cons of both sides. She gave many facts that suported her statment in the begining. She also was very organized with her thoughts and how she organized her writting.","

Then, she also said,"" Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be cleaned"". I wouldn't want to work that hard overseas either.

Finally my last argument is when she said, "" On her second trip, Luke served as night watchman. Her job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making her hourly report to the captain, she slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. Luke's heart raced as she shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped her slide, keeping her from from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. But she couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

M-F170,"The Seagoing Cowgirls, which included Luke Bomberger, had helped many people due to the effect of the Word War II. The Cowgirls were known to help others, beat records from past Seagoing Cowgirls, and meeting new people.

The Cowgirls were a huge help after Word War II. They joined with 43 other nations to form UNRRA (The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administratation), which was to help countries recover animals, food suplies, and more. The UNRRA also hired the ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the young cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas.

When joining any club or, for example, the ""Seagoing Cowgirls"", records are to be broken. When Luke was 18, she had made nine trips, which was the most any Cowgirl has made. This was a big acomplishment for her, because it showed everybody what she could do.

Entering a club is a chance to meet new people. For example, when all the animals were unloaded, it was time to bring out your game side. Luke and the cowgirls would play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

Joining the Seagoing Cowgirls is a wonderful experience, because you have the oppertunity to see new places, help others in need, and of course meet new people. The cowgirls are more than just Seagoing Cowgirls, their people helping people.                        ","

In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.

One reason why the author of this article supports her ideas well is because she used statistics or in other words she used pathos.In paragraph five, she said""...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""She mentioned the idea of NASA creating a ""blimp-like"" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then she went on and entered her counterclaim by saying""...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,""therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.

Secondly,she states some facts about Venus itself.She added that ""...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also she siad that""...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.

Last but not least,in her conclusion she built a strong conclusion by mentionding in her opinion that""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation."" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.

In conclusion, the author supported her ideas well in the article. She supported her idead with statistics from NASA theirselves and she gave facts about Venus. She also included her counterclaims. Over all she gave a well informend and structures article.   ","

M-F175,"Seagoing Cowgirls need more members. The benefits of becoming a Seagoing Cowgirl are visiting exciting places, becoming more aware of people who need help, a young woman might not get drafted into the army, and there is ways that the girls find to have fun after the cattle has been unloaded.

Being able to travel all across the world is a benefit of being a Seagoing Cowgirl. Many take tours and go sightseeing at each destination they arrive at.

A Seagoing Cowgirl will become more aware of the people in need that are around them every single day. Luke Bomberger was a Cowgirl and after she was discharged her family hosted a good number of exchage visitors and international students.

Another reason someone might join the Seagoing Cowgirls program is that they might not get drafted in the army if they are the correct age of 18. They army would see that they are already helping out in the war. They would be helping in the war by bring cattle to the countries that lost most of their cattle and fields.

After the cattle had been unloaded all of the girl on board the ship would play baseball and volleyball in the hold where the cattle had been. Whittling, reading, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and other games were used to pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowgirl let the girls visit exciting places and become more aware of people who need help.

M-F178,"Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowgirls effected her life and how she saw things. She got to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and it impacted her life forever. Other people who want to help the world should definitely participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

The first reason why other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program is because they would get to help recover other countries from the war.

The text states, by the time she was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl. On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowgirls provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on her many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

Finally, others should participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program because it will change their lives. The text states, after her great adventures as a Seagoing Cowgirl, Luke's family was lead to hostess a number of international students for many years. The text also states, this experience opened up the world to Luke. Luke also got to bond with new people on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. She got to spend lots of time with them including times of playing volleyball, baseball, fencing, and many more activities to help pass time.

This shows why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program. They would get to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and impact thier lives forever.      ","

M-F179,"In this passage you have heard about the Seagoing Cowgirls and what they are and what they do. If you had to choose what would you choose do you think that is was right for Luke to convince others to participate in th Seagoing Cowgirls program.

First, for some people some might think that Luke can convince other to join and I am on their side because if she is't able to convince people that how was she able to convince her friend to go with her. She could have just gone by herself and been selfish but she didn't want to be alone and wanted to be nice to her friend and asked her to come because she new that would have beeen the right thing to do. Luke was just trying be kind and nice ""She knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke and her friend Don new that after all that time they didn't have to work two part jobs.

On the other hand, some might think that she shouldn't have to convince others to do that if she has to convince them than they really don't want to go. To some it might not have been a lifetime dream for some people or it might not have been a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are different and some are selfish so some might have thought that she really wasn't serious. So for some people they don't think that she should convince peopele to participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

To wrap this all up, what I think Luke's point of view on convincing others to participate in thye Seagoing

Cowgirls program that she should convince other so go and help because it is the right thing to do. Some think that she shouldn't convince people to go. But at the end of the day everybody is different and everybody think differently so what every you think it is up to you.,","

M-F180,"I think that this new technology can be valuable in many different ways. It can help teachers know why a student is acting different. It can also help teachers know why the kid is not turning in her homework. If the kid is getting in to trouble fighting in school teachers can use this to know why she is doing this to see wat is wrong or how she feels.

If a student is acting different in class teachers can use this new technology to identify her emotions and see why she is acting different. That way teachers can know why and maybe have a little talk with her. So that she stops acting the way she is n stop being disrespetful.

This new technology can also help the teachers know why this kid is not turning in her work. She may not turn in her work because she is sad or is not feeling good if teachers know this then they can talk to the kid and help her start turning her work in so that she can pass her classes and graduate.

If a student is getting into trouble, fighting , talking bad to teachers. The principles can use this knew technology to know why she is doing this or how she is felling maybe there is stuff going on at home and she is felling sad and angry at the same time. If teachers know then they can help this kid out and start to meke the kid make good choices.

Well this is why i think the use of this technology is valuable. hoefully we will have this someday i think that it will be really helpful and usefull for teachers i think they will use it a lot to find out how students are feeling or their emotions.                                           ","

M-F182,"The Seagoing Cowgirls is a great program, but being one is better. The cowgirls go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowgirls would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

Seagoing Cowgirls could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since she was on a cattle-boat trip, they told her she could do that for her service. So if your a Seagoing Cowgirl it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowgirl can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Seagoing Cowgirls are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, she almost fell off because she was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked her ribs on the ship, she didn't quit, she kept being a Seagoing Cowgirl, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowgirls care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great. Because it might be hard work but the animals need all the help they can get.","

""[Essay Content: M-F182 / The Seagoing Cowgirls is a great program, but being one is better. The cowgirls go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowgirls would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

M-F184,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that studying the planet Venus would be a rewarding endeavor. The author presents her claim and supports it very well through the knowledge she already has about the planet, the knowledge that the exploration of Venus might uncover, and persuasion through relating to her readers. This allows for the author to very clearly and precisely get her point across to those who might read the article. It also creates a strong way for the author to connect to her readers.

When the author uses the knowledge that she already has about Venus, she is trying to convey that what information we have on Venus is already important. In Paragraph 4, the author presents the idea that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". When the author introduces this concept, she also describes the surface of Venus to be ""rocky"" and ""includes similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"". Becuase the author presents the idea that Venus might have been like Earth and then goes on to describe this, she strongly supports her claim of how rewarding studying Venus could be. She is also trying to spark an interest in her readers regarding the study of Venus.

In Paragraph 6, the author suggests that researchers need to get closer to the ground.

When she says ""researchers cannot take samples...from a distance"", she is urging scientists to find ways to get closer to Venus's surface. To support this she also presents that scientists ""cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else"" without getting closer. She uses the curiousity of woman to lure them into what she wants them to. This proves to be strong support for her main claim. This also leads right into the persuasion aspect of her support.

The author uses persuasion throughout the article, but in Paragraph 8 it is used excessively. Near the end of the paragraph, she introduces the idea that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". When she uses ""should not"" in that sentence, she is adding a strong opinion to her conclusion. In doing so, her opinion also contributes to the persuasion factor. This allows for her to call out to the reader individually and emotionally affect them. Using persuasion made way for the author to support her claim very well and influence the reader to think the same way as her.

Overall, the author has a very well thought-out way of supporting her claim that studying Venus would be a worthy persuit, despite the dangers. The author hits the brick wall head on by first presenting the knowledge she already has. This allows for the readers to have a little bit of foreground to play on. Then, she introduces the knowledge that could be gained by studying the planet, giving the readers a clear-cut example of how studying Venus might present important information. Finally, she includes persuasion, making it possible to influence the readers one by one. In conclusion, the author supports the claim, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents, very well.","

M-F186,"i think the author did a very good job on explanning her oppion, after reading The Chellenge of Exploring Venus. The reason why I think this is because she did so much reasearch on Venus. She told me how it is the most similuar planet to earth and the closer one to us to. She let me now that it is a very hot planet and could potentially be a hot planet, But by telling me all this it made me want to ask a question weather we could eventually expand humanity to a different planet. Sure enough she answered that questions for me. Its like she ws answering my question before i got to. She made it sound like we deffently need to explore Venus but one of the causes is that she said was safety, they havent sent another space craft down there because they wouldnt come back maybe later on in the future they might but as in right now they send little things up tthere. by reading this she made me think that venus would be woth exploring.

M-F187,"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program because it's a fun and exciting program.

The text states,""The cattle-boat trips were and unbelievable opportunity for a benefiy of seeing Europe and China.""

The text also states,""But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, she says.

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Another reason to join the program is you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff.

The text states,""Luke served as a night watchman.

Her job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The text also states,""But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to her.

One final reason to join the program is because if you like dangerous stuff the program is dangerous.

The text states,""Helping out on her aunt Katie's farm as a girl had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

Her job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making her hourly report to the captain, she slid down a slippery ladder on her backside.

Luke's heart raced as she shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped her slide, keeping her from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

She was happy to be alive.

But she couldn't work for a couple of days because of craked ribs.""

M-F192,"Luke said she grew up on an farm with her aunt so she wanted to help the animals. After World War 2 Luke wanted to help the countries recover by bringing food supplies and animals. Luke loved animals because when she was younger she had lived on a farm. So when she heard UNRRA is hirring Seagoing Cowgirls to take care of Horses,Cows,and Mules she and her friend Don signed up. This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 she could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard she was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowgirl. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""she says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowgirl or girl. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people. Then again you should always help people. Luke went would you?                 ","

M-F195,"Peaple should join this program because you will learn about what the passage is about and write what you think its about. So,Luke was a cowgirl that rode over seas. She rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. She started ride the seas in August,1945. When she was heading for greece she was 18 years old.

So,I think she rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old she was turning. But it wasn't that she wanted to ride the seas she rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous she gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so she told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible she made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took her to cross and eighteen times she crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowgirl was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

Other peaple will have different opinions like adventures are better than being a seagoing cowgirl,hating doing both,or not noing what a seagoin cowgirl or a adventures does.","

M-F196,"I don't think I should be working with a bunch of cracked ribs gals. Oh shut up you are just tring to get out of work,said Jon. Luke spoke back saying,no I Iike this job. Theres no way you actilly like this job,theres just no way. As this arguement went on Rob was silantly siting there,not getting involved but then Luke asked her for backup. Luke is right, how would you feel Jon if someone was yelling at you for getting hurt,said Rob. Shut up,Rob don't you agree with me that it is not fair. Not fair? The mans ribs are shatered.

Shatered? Her ribs were touched. Luke yelled at her if she wanted her ribs touched by her. Then Jon backed out scard but she did'ent give up. The reason Jon is doing it is because she thinks that Luke purpesly broke her ribs. You see Jon did'ent have a choice to come here because she was forced by her mom. Her mom sent her because she would not move out of there house and she wanted her gone.

Jon dicided that she would go talk to the captin about it. The weird thing though is she did'ent tell them that are else they would come too. So she went to the captin telling her lies. The captin got really upset and went to talk to Luke. The captin was very angry now and she was just about to push Luke over bored but she did'ent because she would go to jail. When she reached Luke she yelled at her. Luke asked why. Wy are you yelling at me captin? You know exacily why I am yelling at you Luke. No I really don't.

I am yelling at you because you purpusely broke your ribs. Where did you get that from captin. Jon told me that she herd you say that to yourself. Look Jon told you lies because even if I did do that I don't talk to myself. You don't, yelled the captin. No,said Luke. Great now I have to talk to Jon. Im comeing too,said Luke. So they went to talk to Jon. They found her in the lounge. They walked up to her and started to talk.

The captin told her that she had giving false infomation. Jon talked back and said she is lieing and she really did do it on purpose. The captin ignored it. So Jon told them her story. The reason I thought she purposely did it was because I thought all the people here were forced to do this too. Luke told her that she joined with her friend because they thought it would be fun so they did it. After they did it once Luke wanted to do it again because she liked it so much. After they told each others storys they settiled there argument and became best friends.           ","

The captin got really upset and went to talk to Luke. The captin was very angry now and she was just about to push Luke over bored but she did'ent because she would go to jail. When she reached Luke she yelled at her. Luke asked why. Wy are you yelling at me captin? You know exacily why I am yelling at you Luke. No I really don't.

I am yelling at you because you purpusely broke your ribs. Where did you get that from captin. Jon told me that she herd you say that to yourself. Look Jon told you lies because even if I did do that I don't talk to myself. You don't, yelled the captin. No,said Luke. Great now I have to talk to Jon. Im comeing too,said Luke. So they went to talk to Jon. They found her in the lounge. They walked up to her and started to talk.

The captin told her that she had giving false infomation. Jon talked back and said she is lieing and she really did do it on purpose. The captin ignored it. So Jon told them her story. The reason I thought she purposely did it was because I thought all the people here were forced to do this too. Luke told her that she joined with her friend because they thought it would be fun so they did it. After they did it once Luke wanted to do it again because she liked it so much. After they told each others storys they settiled there argument and became best friends.           ]""

M-F197,"In this passage we see Luke's experience as a Seagoing Cowgirl.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowgirl gave her awareness for other people. She also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowgirl Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

She fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said she had to make sure she fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

She also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

She said she saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

She also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

She and the other cowgirls played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed her help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowgirls program, Luke helped many others, even after she was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowgirls program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.              ","

When Luke was a young woman she worked two part time jobs and her friend offered her one of the part time jobs. Luke then helped out in the army for world war 2 and she was happy that she joined because she helped out people of her own kind. Now what i mean is that if you want to help out in fighting for our country go right ahead and help out like Luke. Luke had a lot of jobs and she had a great time in the jobs and she did them well and she loved her jobs. Luke did have a good life and she help a lot of people out so do the same with your life. You can help a lot of people when you can see that some one needs help it does not matter what you are doing just stop what it is and go help. You can make a good life doing that the people will appricate what you can do for them.

M-F199,"Would you participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls progam? I would so I can visit many places and take adventures. It seems really fun to go to Europ, China, or anywhere else she goes. It just seems really exciting to go journeys and adventures with friends, and explore the outside world.

In the passage it says ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China."" To me i don't think i would be able to stay on a boat for two weeks and a month its jsut alot of sitting down, and you dont get any rest. Its alot to do when your travling for two weeks and a month.

My argument about Luke's point of view is that it would seem pretty cool to sail and go on journeys with Luke.

She seems like a person who would love people to come along with her on her jouneys and help her explore new things, and keep watch for things, animals, and maybe people. Luke just seems like a very active person who loves people to help her explore.

I think this because she's very very active and she likes to explore. She enjoys her doing what she does if she can travel for more than two weeks. If she can explore and help out . That really shows that she loves her job.         ","

M-F203,"Their are three reasons why Luke's point of view convince people that they should participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program. One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,she does what she likes to do,and she gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowgirl's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says ""but the Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"".""It opended up a new world for her"". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,""I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,""she says.""It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs.""thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

I can support that she gets to do what she likes to when the texts says that ""Biside helping people ,I had a side benifitt of seeing

Europe and China. I can also support that she likes what hes doing when the text says ""Luke also tored and excavatede Crete and marvoloues at the Panamna Canal on her way to China.""

I can support that found free time to do fun thing when the text says the cow girls played baseball and volleyball table tennis and more fun things. They also boxed read whiting and more those are the reasons how she got to do fun things

In conclusion she did alot of things to inspire people to be a Seagoing Cow girl. If mre people were like hime the world would be a better place. ","

M-F207,"Luke Bomberger works at two jobs and has a busy life style. She works at the grocery store and at the bank. Don, her friend asked if she wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke didn't know what to say, because it was an opportunity of a life time. So she decided to go, they were to go overseas to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. In 1945 they recieved there orders to New Orleans and they arrived August 14, 1945. Eventually, they headed to Greece with 335 horses also with eniugh hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned the age 18 before arriving to greece which meant she could be ready to participate for military service. When they learned she was on a cattle boat they told me to keep doing what I was doing. Luke had made 9 trips, more than any Seagoing Cowgirl ever. It was an amazing opportunity for Luke, she loved visiting ancient things. Luke didn't just have to me stuck in a boat with horses she got to also go out and adventure. It took 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean, from the eastern coast of the United States. Also another month to get china, this seems like hard work. But the animals kept Luke busy, they had t be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay had to be pulled from ship to feed them. Luke had some experience by helping on Katies farm as a girl. On lukes second trip at a Seagoing Cowgirl, she was to be night watchman her had to check on the animals every hour. A rainy night she had to go down a ladder, her feet slipped then a small trip of metal caught her from tumbling of the boat. She was happy to be alive, even with a few cracked ribs so she couldnt work for a couple days. Luke always had fun on board though. She got to play games which would make time go faster. Games such as volleyball, baseball, tennis and more. Being a Seagoing cowgirl wasnt just an adventure she had fun to and the world open up to her. It made her aware of many opportunities. As you can tell Luke has a busy life with everything going on but she enjoys being a part of many things. Luke is glad her friend Don let her go on this trip.","

When she claimed that Venus is useful because of how close it is and said "" ...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long frames of space travel."" and then said "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" so she made a claim saying that it is a good thing to go to venus but the right after said the value is indisputable but never gave any evidence of why its so good to go to.

This claim would be much better if she actually listed any good benefits from Venus.

The author believes that studying Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author supports her idea very well by proving many good points and using factual evidence.

The author supports her idea by proving good points and using evidence. You can tell she is sincere about this and would like for the scientists to try and further explore Venus and its commodoties. For example, in paragraph 8, she talks about how our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts. This is a very reasonable statement, and proves that she actually has a reason to want Venus to be explored. Also in paragraph 8, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This quote supports the authors idea because she is giving an ethical reason about why she wants scientists to create the technology to be able to put humans on Venus. She is explaining to the readers why she wants this to take place, and by giving her opinion, it automatically supports her and her idea.

The author does many things to help support her idea throughout this article. She is very opinionated about why she wants there to be people on Venus. The author support her idea very well by proving many good points and using factual evidence.","

Beause in A Cowgirl Who Rode The Waves luck creaked her ribs beacuse she have to check on some animals and then she fell and she thought she was going overboard but metal stopped her and she was happy to be alive. If you love to travle and be on the sea then this is a perfect job for you. On the job you go to new plarts of the world.

why you shouldn't join is because you might fall overboard and noone might noice that you fell. Or the ship might fail at working and sink and you might not have a boat incase that might happen. What if the ship gets hit and you all start to sink.

Luke said being a cowgirl is much more than a adverture for Luke Bombeger. Also being a cowgirl opened the world to her and she is greatful for that opportunity of being a cowgirl. She also said it make her more aware of people in countries and their needs.

M-F221,"Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowgirls program because she thinks since when she were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town girl.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think she thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but she is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on her aunt katie's farm as a girl had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching her how to survive on her own she's getting taught and she is changing during this program so thats what she thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program she worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after her high school graduation. she was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when her friend Don invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think she trys to encourage people to join the program.

If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration. Its for SEagoing Cowgirls that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident woman to go on her journey with her best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything!

Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas.

When Luke was on that trip she loved it, she first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended , on August 14th. On her first (1st) trip the crew she was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the women on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 she knew that she could join military. Then she thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so she did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and she was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine her life without the trips she wouldn't have gone on so she stayed on going with it and she was confident in her choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. She also got to help people all over the world. She was so proud of what she did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of her journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night she slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal she was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger!

M-F226,"In a Cowgirl who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowgirls program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowgirls would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that she just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, she got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that she did the same things on her Aunts farm, but did not help her at sea. One day a bad storm hit and she landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , she could not work for a few days because of her broken ribs. She was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. She had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, she crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job she helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . She helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all she had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved her job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to her. After that she raised more awareness. All i know is that she will , Survive !","

M-F227,"Luke Bomberger became a Seagoing Cowgirl she helps people whose lives had been affected by World War ll. Luke became a Seagoing

Cowgirl because she knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as she says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowgirl and she loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that she needed to do and is something that is important to her.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between her journeys, she got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on her way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that she went and was happy that she could see it and that she go to experience the jouney.

In conclusion Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowgirl she loves all the sights, all the help that she can give to these other people, and that she could have this opportunity in life.                  ","

M-F230,"You should really join the Seagoing Cowgirls because they have lots of fun even though it might seem scary to be on a boat with horses then yes but it is actually pretty safe. Luke may have broke a few ribs and other stuff but she had fun and if you live on a farm then you would be good for it because you have to clean out stalls and feed them and put out bals of hay for them to munch on. You could be on the next boat to be a Seagoing Cowgirl of Cowgirl. You may have to do night patroll but it don't matter as long as youhave fun. Maybe even bring a friend so you don't feel so lonely if you don't know anyone.

If you don't like boats then don't do it if you like boats and horses then your the one to apply and we will send you a ticket to get on the boat and be on your way. If you want to see the world or some parts of it then sign up and come join us because we go everywhere you can imagine like China, New Zealand, and Crete. These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when she came other than the friend that asked her to go with her to be a Seagoing Cowgirl. Luke made many new friends on the boat. She made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that she had with that job. She had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

She thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but she changed her mind it being completely amazing better than what she thought it would be for someone like her. Her journeys were amazing and she loved it and her family was very proud of her and her friend. She said she is grateful for the opportunity. She also said it made her more aware of people of other countries and there needs. The awareness stayed with her and it lead her family to hostess many of international students and exchange visiters and students for many years.

M-F231,"Luke Bomberger works at a grogrocery store and a bank, she wants to get a better job. Her good friend Don Reist gave her an opportunity of a lifetime. Don had invited her to got to Europe on a cattle boat, she excepted the invite. Luke just knew that this would change her life.

In the middle of the story people realized that people, animals, and more looked dried out, so 44 nations had joined to form UNRRA and hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls.""Luke and Don had signed up for it, knowing that they were going to help animals. When they had arrived from taking the animals to New Orleans the day the Pacific War had ended. They had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed them. Luke had recently turned 18 before arriving to Greece. She had made 9 trips before being discharged.

I think that thanks to Don, Luke had gotten a great job just for her. I also think that Luke enjoyed the buisness she was in and what she was doing. Don is very encouraging, helpful, nice, and thanks to all of that she had gotten her friend,Luke, a job. Luke had later began helping her auntie on the farm and it prepared her for hard work.

M-F232,"Have you ever tried becoming a seagoing cowgirl? If not, I suggest that you consider joining the program. The job of a seagoing cowgirl is to take care of horses, young cows, and mules which are sent overseas to people that need them. While being in the Seagoing Cowgirl program, there are many positive things such as being able to experience adventures, visiting many unique places, and having the opportunity to help people in need.

A Seagoing Cowgirl is able to experience many adventures. When Luke was a seagoing cowgirl, she had the chance of experiencing a storm while at sea. Think about how exciting and adventurous that would be! Also Luke says that she found time to have fun on board, especially once all the animals were taken care of or unloaded. The cowbobys would then play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds, or set up different sporting tournements. Experiencing a storm at sea and playing many fun games on board are just two examples of the many adventures that could take place as a seagoing cowgirl.

If you are a seagoing cowgirl, you not only have adventures but you also can see and visit many unique places that an average person wouldn't have the opportunity to see or experience. In Luke's nine years as a seagoing cowgirl, she was able to see and experience some pretty interesting things in Europe and China. She specifically saw the Acropolis in Greece, and thought that that experience was very special. On top of seeing the Acropolis, she also was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. There would also be many more places to go and people to see.

The main reason for becoming a seagoing cowgirl would be to help people in need. Luke specifically helped people affected by World War II. The people affected by World War II needed food, clothing, animals, and more. Luke helped with the animals. Luke states that she was very grateful for the opportunity of becoming a seagoing cowgirl so she could help people in need. She says that it made her ""more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Becoming a seagoing cowgirl is a great experience and very beneficial. Luke says, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town girl."" ","

Which can lead to conflicting sides. Her idea that it will be worthy it is not supported very well for a couple reasons.

Her idea is not supported all that well. She used more of what she thought than facts. Such as this qoute "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

This qoute supports my idea because how does she know that there is insight to be gained on that plant. With that how does she know that human curiosty will lead us to equally endeavors. She needs to uses sources and support her sources. She even goes back to the dangerous that each one can lead to. She does not stay strong in just one idea, she circles back to the other idea. A qoute from the text that proves my point is "" Modern computers are enormously powerful and flexible and quick. but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

She always has a reason behind why it won't work or why it is dangroues. the author may feel like she needs to put why it wouldn work or the dnagerous but it just makes their writing weaker

In conclusion the author does not support her idea well. She has conflicting sides and she always seems to have a reasons why it could be dangroues. She also seems to have very little facts they are mostly just opions. The author needed to stick to one idea and find facts to support that reason. Intead of just going back and forth between ideas.

M-F239,"Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War ll. In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowgirl, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowgirl.

To become a Seagoing Cowgirl you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When she was going to make her hourly report to her captin she fell on a slippery ladder and cracked her ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowgirl. If you are a Seagoing Cowgirl you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also she had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took her ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowgirls got to have some fun. The cowgirls played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowgirl isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowgirls in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowgirls.      ","

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowgirls in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowgirls.      ]""

M-F240,"Why do you think Don Reist want Luke Bomberger to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program ? Well , i think she wants her to join the Seagoing cowgirls program because she probably really like it , and want her friend to join .

One reason i think Luke joined because like she say , she think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime . in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowgirls to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended .

Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because her friend was their and she wanted to be with her friend , and do what she are doing now . The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that she was on a cattle boat , they told her to just keep doing that for her service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant she could be drafted in military service .

The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like her and asked her to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowgirl program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . ""            ","

M-F241,"Luke's claim was that when her friend Don invited her to a trip to Europe on a cattle boat and Luke knew right away she had to say yes because it was a once

in a lifetime opportunity. Also that she got to travel and exploer many diffrent

places! Another one of Lukes claim was that she was greatful for the opportunity she got to have by being a seagoing cowgirl.

A few reasons to join the club it that you get to go places you probobly never been before. Also that you get to travel all over the world and explore diffrent places and see many diffrent things from many diffrent paces, just like Luke!

It may have taken her two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china but, it may have been worth it because Luke got to see many diffrent things and explore unique stuff! Luke would normally be caring for the animals and so it kept her busy for a long time.The cowgirls played baseball and volleyball games so, if you like those games you might want to join them! Being a seagoing cowgirl was much more fun than an adventure, it opened the world to Luke. Luke said she was greatful for the opportunity.

"" I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. "" That is what Luke said because she enjoyed being a seagoing cowgirl and going on all the adventures that Luke got to do! Maybe one day if you become a seagoing cowgirl you will be able to adventure all the things Luke got to do. There may

be some rough time like what Luke had when she couldn't work for a few days, for an example,

when she was a watchman and it was a rainy night Luke sliped

and fell and she had a few broken ribs but she was saved by a small strip of metal

along the edge so it stopped Luke from sliding. Luke aws happy to be alive

though! Luckly for Luke she recovered in a few days. Luke was happy to be a cowgirl and you might too!

So now maybe you can consider about being a saegoign cowgirl.                                         ","

I think that Luke Bomberg would want others to join the seagoing cowgirls because, It could make you more aware of other countries, it is also fun and you get to experience other cultures.

M-F247,"Do you know what a seagoing cowgirl is? Luke Bomberger was a ''seagoing cowgirl'',a person who helped foreign countries of sea's after WWII. Luke was apart of the UNRRA, (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)to help foreign country's who have been left in ruins get back on their feet. On her way to Europe,she had to cross the large and vast Atlantic Ocean.

To pass time on there way to Europe they played games such as,Table-Tennis,fencing,and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass time. The way Luke got into the seagoing cowgirl business,was her friend asked her if she wanted to join her,and she couldn't pass up this surreal oppurtunity. But, the downside was she she had to travel the rambunctious sea's. The ship Luke and Don boarded to take these cattle over to Europe is the SS Charles W. Wooster.

Reasons join this program are that you get to help others get back on their feet in times of disaster such as war,hurricane,tsunami,nuclear disaster,or other types of disasters that may happen. But their also some dangers to be aware of. During one of Luke's journey's to Europe she slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. If it weren't for a small strip of metal she would have fallen into the dark Atlantic Ocean. But,besides broken ribs she was glad she wasn't sleeping with the fishes,literally!

It's also an adventure to. During another one of her trips she got to boat around the watery ""streets"" of Venice,Italy in a gondola. Also while in Greece she visited a excavated castle. She also marveled the Panama Canal on her way to

China. But,what came most in handy is that she used to help her Aunt Katie on her farm as a girl so, Luke was prepared for the hard work.

So as a conclusion to this story, I would hope you join an organization that helps others in need, especially countries overseas. Even though this job might be hard, your making a difference in our world and there's. You could join an orginization like UNRRA,or just simply join and orginization that helps new Americans,like immigrants from foreign countries fit in in our society today in America. That would be a good example our country could set for other countries. This should be our goal for every thing and anything. Are goal should be to help others and just not ourselves. We need to stop being selfish and help other's get back on there feet if their in times of need. This is the example we should set as The United States of America.","

M-F249,"Being a Seagoing Cowgirl is much more than just taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls for the animals.

Doing this, it could open up your eyes to a new world and explore new places.

Luke though it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town girl, she says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, she says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

The fact that Luke thought helping all of those people in need, shows you that she wanted to help them.

But, not only was she taking care of the people and helping them, she was also helping the animals. I think she also liked taking care of the animals herself.

When people think of a Cowgirl, they see someone wearing cowgirl boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowgirl, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

She also marveled at the Panama Canal, during her trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, she must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowgirl can open up a new world to you. Not only does it let you visit new and unique places, you get to help animals and people that are in need of it.

It sure was like that to luke.","

Luke Bomberger is apart of the Seagoing Cowgirls program and thinks it would be great if new faces would join the program as well. So Luke is thinking about how she'd get the message out to people so they could probably be in the program. ''I should talk to the others and see what they think."" Luke said, so she spreads the word to the other gals and they all think it's a great idea. Luke was amazed everyone was wanting others to join the program also. All of a sudden luke thought to herself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So she told the gals that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the gals blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here."" So the other gals gave her a high five and telling her that's an brilliant idea. So the gals took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where. So Luke lead the the group of ladies in the little radio station and spoted an old woman drinking coffe just sitting there. So as soon as Luke said 'Excuse me madam?.'' The old woman jumped up instantainioulsy and said, 'AHHH! who are you and what do you want?"". So all the ladies introduced theirselfs and told the old woman how trhey needed to let others know about their program and how they needed her help. So the old woman responded with, ""What's in it for me?"" the ladies thought for a moment and one said, 'Oh i know, if you let us use your thingy majigger here you can leave this boring job and come with us."" So the old woman thought for a moment and then said ""Deal"". So the old woman turned on her machine to have all the gals on the radio then she counted down ""3...2...1...and action."" So Luke spoke first and said ''Ladies and ladies come one come all to be apart of the Seagoing Cowgirls program."" then she gave out all the infomation then in less in two minutes the radio station started to get dozens of phone calls and all the women that called were excepted and flew out to where all the other women were. Three day later it was time to take off and get ready to start sailing so Lucas did a head count. The program started out with 24 members but when Lucas was done counting the program had 148 members in all. Lucas was happy with the success and progress that was made, so everyone got settled in and started to sail.","

Would you like to be part of the Seagoing Cowgirls program? If you don't, I am going to tell you about a text I read about a woman. In this text, it says that a woman named Luke Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when her friend Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. She knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA, a relief and rehabilitation administration. UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowgirls'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and her friend Don signed up for the Seagoing Cowgirls program. In the text it also says that Luke went on cattle-boat trips. She also got to go to many places across the country. She also found time to have fun on board, ecspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowgirls played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to her. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" she says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That oppotunity of a lifetime is good to have because you could experience adventures you have never experienced before, and that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

Not to mention you got to help out with nation getting back there food supplies back up. Plus you did get to do a lot of sight seeing when you are a Seagoing Cowgirl

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small- town girl,"" she says. ""Beside helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"" she says. "" So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with street of water. ""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

It is not all just fun and games for Luke. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out her aunt Katie's farm as a girl had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On her second tripLuke served as night watchman. Her job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, After making her hourly report to the captain, she slid down a slippery ladder on her backside. Luke's heart raced as she shot feet first towardan opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped her slide, keeping her from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. She was happyto be alive. But she couldn't work a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to her. ""I'm grateful the opportunity.""

she says.

""It made me more aware of people of countries and there needs."" And that awareness stayed with her, leading her family to hostess a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years. One more think thought is that you need to be prepared you couldn't just walk in with no traing and say ""Can I join you people.""    ","

M-F261,"The Seagoing Cowgirl Heros

Do you like going to new places around the world? Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program? If you would, then go to China. The Seagoing Cowgirls program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected bt World War 2.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that her life would change soon after her high school graduation. She was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when her friend Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. She know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. She had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recovert their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowgirls program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reson is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

The cowgirls played baseeball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

""[Essay Content: M-F261 / The Seagoing Cowgirl Heros

Do you like going to new places around the world? Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowgirls program? If you would, then go to China. The Seagoing Cowgirls program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected bt World War 2.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that her life would change soon after her high school graduation. She was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when her friend Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. She know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. She had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recovert their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowgirls program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reson is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

The cowgirls played baseeball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worlkd to her. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,"" she says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness styaed with her, leading her family to hostess a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. So, after i gave you reasons and supported my answer with details, would you want to go to Seagoing Cowgirls program?? ]""

M-F262,"Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. When her friend Don asked her to go on a cattle boat Luke couldn't say no. It was and opportunity of a life time and Luke knew it. In 1945 the World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins.44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Rlief and Rehabilition Administration).They hired seagoing cowgirls to take care of all the animals. So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that she could be drafed at any time to go to war. When she told them that she was on a cattle-boatr trip they told her to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow girl has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town girl Luke say. besides helping people she also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when she saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to her Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little she helped her aunt Katie's farm ou when she was a girl and she has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach her the dangers of the sea though. When she was on her secened trip she was a night watchman. She had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of her helping on a farm when she was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When she was reporting to the captin one time she slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop her from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and her life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got. I found out that that peice of meatal craked her ribs so she could not work for a acouple of days witch that might of hert her body every day till it was helled but i do nt know because i am not Luke and that is the end of my story.

M-F263,"The Author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well in this writting. Teh author is good at showing the two diffrernent sides to the agument but makes you agree with her stance. She used many diffrent examples and also gae a lot of detail in her writting.

To start off her essay with some facts and expalined what she was going to be talking about and some things about planets. One fact she used to start her essay off was "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" ( paragraph 3) This was a great way to start off the writting because she informed her readers about venus before she started to persaude them on a topic.

The author also displaces the oposing information which is always a good thing to do in a pusasive writting. An example of this is "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for human."" ( Paragraph 5) This is higlighing that yes Venus has some dangerous things but is still worthy. So by doing this she is showing the dangers but then can back them up and say some good things about them.

Following this, The author was really good at making the dangerous stuff sound not as bad, one example of this is ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely for above teh planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrated the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" (paragraph 6) This supports that she is a good authour and deplaning her stance on the agurmeny becasue she can make the other side information help her stance in an way.

In conclusion, the author did a great job at suporting her idea. The diffrent ways of supporting it made it seem more persasive and she got across alot of ideas and information.                  ","

M-F264,"Their are many reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls programs. One of Luke's reason you should join the the Seagoing Cowgirls program is having the ability to see the world. Luke did this when she was with the Seagoing Cowgirls program. She traveled to Europe and China. Luke saw the Acropolis in Greece. Luke was also able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Another one of Luke's reason you shouls join the Seagoing Cowgirls program is helping the animals. The Seagoing Cowgirls program was hired by the UNRRA to take good care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas to other countries. Luke was able to feed the horses with hay and oats. Luke had to water and feed the animals two to three times a day. She also had to clean the animals stall. Luke had to haul bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ships. Luke also had the job of checking up on the animals at night every hour.

Another one of Luke's reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program is how much fun you can have. On the return trips when the animals have been unloaded. Luke and her fellow cowgirls played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been housed. Luke and her cowgirl friends played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and other games also helped the cowgirls to have fun and pass the time.

Those were three of Luke's reason of why you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls programs. Lets review what those three reasons are the first one is being able to see the world, the second one is being able to help and care for the animals, and the last reason is being able to have fun.","

M-F266,"In the story, ""A Cowgirl Who Rode the Waves,"" Luke is a girl from a small town and is a cowgirl that is almost 18 years old.

Next, she should make posters to show people that the Seagoing Cowgirls extict. Then, she should say where they going and how they are seeing all of the different historial places along the way. Finally, she should tell the people what the program offers and how they visit many unique places.

Also, you see a lot of different cultures. You would get to see the way that people live. Then, when you are over there you can see what the country's culture is. Like, when you are in China you can see all of the stuff that they make over there. You might even see some of the places that were attacked. When you go different place, you get to see different things that you may of never seen before. When you are over seas you can see many interseting things. That is one reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program.

Another reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowgirls program is that once you drop off all of the animals and help the people you have one or two months with open animal cages.

In the article she provides the example of a floating car above venus to show that a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the conditions but it would provide little sight. She uses to example to illustrate what it would be like to avoid the conditionsby showing this is what the would have to do. She also provides examples to an alternative by saying that there could be electronics to avoid the risks. By providing both of these examples it gives the reader some relateable examples to get an insight into her point.

NASA is a world wide administration that has credibility over the course of its govern. By providing examples of what NASA is doing to show that it should be done, then if NASA is working on it then it makes her point credible. She quotes NASA'S approches on studying Venus so that it can avoid the risks to show that it is possible to explore Venus without the risks. A NASA solution would be that a person could float above the fray. They also have considered sending electronices so it is possible. She saying that it might be difficult but it is attainable. This supports the claim that she supports her claim impresively because she uses sources.

In most arguments the person views the other side so that they can provide an alternative to what they are saying. She uses cons such as no mission has had a woman, 97% of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth, and that it could crash a submarine. But then she says that Venus has benefits to that out way the dangers. The benfits include: it is the brightest point, it is close to Earth compared to other space travels, long ago it could support life, and it will expand the edges of imagination and innovation. She provides benefits to out weigh the cons of exploring Venus. She does a great job of explaining why exploring Venus has value and can provides insight to other counter arguments that might rise from others opionions. This is why she does an impressive job supporting her argument.

In conclusion, the author provided points in the argument to make the opinion more credible and also stronger to the reader. In the article the author provided examples, a wide known credible source, and viewed the other side. She impressively supported her opinon that the mission to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Without her evidence to suppport her opinion the article would have not had such an impact on the reader. This is why she did an impressive job supporting her idea.     ","

M-F268,"The Seagonig Cowgirls are a group of people who helped serve after World War 2. They brought horses and small cows to towns that were in ruins. To help these countrys they brought food and cattle. They went across the Pacific and Atlantic ocean to give the homeless food.

People should join this program because it help a town in need of assistance. If they didnt they could starve to death. They need to join this program not just for the people you are helping but to help yourself see the good inside yourself. Take Luke, she is a seagoing cowgirl that made 9 trips. That is the longest any seagoing cowgirl has ever went.

It clearly states on paragraph 5 that "" Besides helping people, I had a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" She also says it is an oppertunity of a lifetime. She said she couldnt say no. She says it takes about 2 weeks to get across the Alantic ocean. She went over the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific ocean twice to help those affected by World War 2.

In conclusion, people should join the seagoing cowgirls. There are many side benifits of doing so. You could things you could never see and still help people. So, will you join the seagoing cowgirls?","

M-F269,"Luke should use these reason's to convince other people. The program helps with people in need, people around the world that need supplies, and livestock. The Seagoing Coyboys program is a program for helping other's.

The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then she slipped and cracked her ribs so she coudn't work for a couple days. She also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. She went to many parts of Europe. In Greece she got drafted with the military. She went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean she took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph she worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe she gave cattle to people or farmers. She probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

The Seagoing Cowgirls program is a program for helping others. To sum marize the reasons. The program helps with people in need, the program goes around the world, and the program helps with livestock and supplies. Luke did a great thing to help with the world. ","

M-F270,"Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that she took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when she saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowgirl meant that she supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowgirl is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowgirl was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that she would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept her busy along with other things she had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowgirl is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to her. She also so said that it made her more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That is why you should become a Seagoing Cowgirl.   ","

Then i gave her my response she said why you don't think it's aliens i told her i don't belive and aliens. She said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told her the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. The argument kept going on because she said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.

Last, we came together an said we dont know cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien. She did not like my response when i said i dont know how they look how they sound thats why i said it was not a alien. It also kept going cause i did not like her response she did give me details or nothing.

She was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Luke signed up to join the program, which is, UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrations). The program hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls.""

The program hired ""Seagoing Cowgirls"" because they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and her friend signed up and they went to New Orleans. They found horses there. They keep on going to places, that was like an adventure to them. They keep on going and they were arriving to Greece for their second mission.

Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. By the time she was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowgirl. Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" Luke was also taking a ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water too. She was looking at a lot of things in Greece. Her next stop was at China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlanta Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was so busy taking care of the animals. She took so many adventures. Being a Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to her.

There was a lot of adventures going on. It took her years to go around the world and explore. She was great of being a Seagoing Cowgirl. She even loved to going to this mini adventures. It was a great experinced.           ","

M-F275,"She did a good job supporting her idea, i see that she keeps comparing it to earth. She said that Venus is the closest planet to earth. She also said the air pressure of Venus would be cose to that of sea level on earth.

However venus is the hottest planet but is second from the sun. I personally ould not go to Venus even if i had a chance. She also mentioned that Venus doesnt have easy conditions but are survivable for humans.

The author also explained that the atmosphere would liquefy many metals. If so it would be very dangerous to go to Venus unless the structure is strong enough to pass thru the atmosphere. There is a 97 percent carbon dioxide atmosphere that blankets Venus.

You can tell this aurthor did some research before writing this. She is very detailed in this passage. All in all i think this aurthor did a very nice job writing this passage and backing herself up by details.   ","

To help these countries recover 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA to give them food supplies, animals , and more.

Luke liked doing it so much that she did it many more times.

She crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II.

When they were coming back they played games in th eempty stalls to pass the time.

M-F278,"Have you ever been through a major change? You probably have and so has Luke Bomberger, she went from being a rootin tootin cowgirl to a seagoing cowgirl. So, many people like change, some people hate it. In fact I feel that change is good for us, it helps us come 1,000,000,000,000 miles out of our comfort zone. So if I were you I would take as many chances as I could.

For one Bomberger had a blast traveling to many different places, it says in paragraph 5 she toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the panama canal on her way to China .Crazy amazing, right? She was admiring one place on her way to another. What a lucky gal.

Another thing is Bomberger Got to go places that many people may never go. For example She had been to China, Eastern coast of the US, and Europe. Way farther out of North America then Ill ever be. She was probably millions of miles away from where her comfort zone (her house).

Also just the over-all experience you get when you do or try something new. Bomberger states in paragraph 9 that being a seagoing cowgirl was much more fun of an adventure. Its all about the people you share the moment with also, they could make it adventerious, scary, fun, or sad.

But do you see getting pushed of of a 1,000,000,000,000 building (your comfort zone) can be fun, scary, or of course uncomfortable. So next time you want to say no to some thing, take chances and say YES. ","

M-F279,"Why should you become a Seagoing Cowgirl? Well first let me tell you about a girl named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowgirl. A Seagoing Cowgirl is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowgirls. To go help Europe where World War II just ended.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat she had a job to do. She had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. She also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowgirl you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make her hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowgirl wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowgirls played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowgirl is and what she does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowgirl. Take the information that I gave you. Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowgirl and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you. ","

M-F280,"This persuasive essay is about why you should join the the Seagoing Cowgirl Program. The Seagoing Cowgirl Program is an amazing program with a lot to offer. You could change your life easily by going into the program.

Luke Bomberger had no idea her life would change but ""She knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke said that ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town girl"" She also said ""Besides helping people I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

M-F281,"Luke had no idea that her life was about to change. She has two part time jobs at a bank and a grocery store. Her friend Don had asked her if she wanted to go on a cattle boat to Europe because after World War II it left most cities in ruins. Luke had no choice but to say yes. So in August of 1945 Luke and Don went to New Orleans to take apart in helping families. After getting their papers from the seaman they went and borded the SS Charles W. Wooster, they headed for Greece with a cargo of 355 plus horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke ended up turning 18 before arriving at Greece. Luke realized that she could be drafted for military service but everyone just told her to what she's doing now as her military service. On her second trip she served as night watchman after doing her hourly report to the captian it was a rainy night and the ladders were slick and Luke slipped down the ladder on her backside and almost feel feet first out of the ship into the dark Dark Atlantic Ocean. But a small piece of metal caught and saved her. She was happy to be alive. But she couldn't do anything for a couple days because of some cracked ribs. Luke said it's more fun on the way back because when they drop off the animals the stalls are empty and they can play games like baseball, table tennis, and volleyball. They all say it's one thing that cuts time off the journey. Luke also made nine trips the most anyone has ever made. THat is why Luke likes being a Seagoing Cowgirl.","

M-F282,"Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". The author did not support her topic very well, because she didn't support her main idea enough, she strayed away from the topic many times, and her information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.

First, the author brings up her topic of "" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight she wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; she then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring. Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with her main idea. The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though her main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out. One of the points brought up was ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth"". The author uses the word ""probably"" which means that she doesn't know this to be a fact or not. The author also wrote ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus"" ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus. A good informative or arguementative essay provides facts to supports its ideas, rather than just guessing or presuming.

The author does not suport her ideas well, because she draws the reader away from the topic many times, she doesn't support her thesis very well, and the evidence she does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the ""danger"" aspect of it, and she should focus more on the ""why"" aspect of her idea . So, it would be best if she looked over her essay and ,with her thesis in mind, start over from scratch.","

Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then she thought, that would be the opportunity of her lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. She also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town girl!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. She enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowgirl.

Being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up her world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowgirls program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that.

In the book ''A Cowgirl Who Rode the Waves.'' A character from that book name Luke joined the Seagoing Cowgirls program. Her friend Don Reist invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. She knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime! In 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries where left ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).

Then in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14. Luke then says,''the day the Pacific war ended.''

M-F290,"This story is about Luke Bomberger a girl who rode the waves had no idea that her life would change soon after her graduation. She was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and at a bank when her friend invited her to go to Europe on a cattle boat. She couldn't say no she knew it would be an opportunity for her. It was 1945,world war 2 was over in Europe and countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover 44 nations came together and started UNRRA {The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration}. UNRRA hired seagoimg cowgirls to take care of the horses,young cows, and the mules.

The first reason to join the program is because they came together and started a group of 44 nations to help Europe. They hired ''Seagoing Cowgirls'' to help the animals. They are trying to get the nation back together. Luke and Don signed up for it to. Heading over seas in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived ''August 14,'' Luke sayed,the day the Pacific war ended.''

The second reason you should join the group is because '' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town girl,'' she said.''Besides helping people, had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,'' she says. ''So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.'' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to china.

The third reason why you should join the group is cause caring for the animals during the crossings kept luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hayand bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on her aunt Katie's farm as a girl had prepared luke for hard work.

In conclusion I think you can still help with or without an reward. She did that from heart to help and sign up for that, also she liked watching the animals every hour and taking care of them so did her friend. She really liked the trips around the world too, just help to be nice somtimes for other people.","

Luke said, ""Being a Seagoing Cowgirl she got to see Europe, China and she got to see the Acropolis in Greece."" She got to see so many great sites. Luke toured an excaveted castle in crete and she marveled at the Panama Canal on her way to China.

Luke had to travel a lot. But, even though it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to China. On the long journey

Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowgirls played lots of games. Some of the games they played was baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals lived. They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time.

Luke said that ""being a Seagoing Cowgirl was much more than an adventure."" For Luke it opened up the world to her. Luke had a lot of fun seeing different sites, meeting new people, playing fun games and caring for people in a different, and better way.                       ","

Luck wanted to help all the people she could im sure of it but when she got hurt she left just the people that were already helping people get better.So when people want to save people they just didn't want to save just people they wanted to save animals to.Then Luck knew she could help the animals or all the animals that she could in stead of just helping people and kids.So Luck tried to help all the people,kids,and anilmals there.They might have saved every one there no one knows if they got saved.","

M-F297,"The Seagoing Cowgirls were great heroines to other country's because they transported food and horses for people who didn't have food or any transportation. Just think how good you would feel if you knew that you saved people lives just by giving them food. Well i'm going to tell you what it would feel like and why you should become a Seagoing Cowgirl.

Just think of becoming a true life heroine, you could become a soldier,nurse,doctor, or a Seagoing Cowgirl! Seagoing Cowgirls were people (women) who transported Cows, Mules, and Horses. They transported them from America to Europe,Greece,and China. Europe was left in ruins after World War || was over, so people signed up to become a Seagoing Cowgirl. They would get on ships with 300+ horses, cows, and mues and enough hay and oats to feed them. A Seagoing Cowgirl would check up on them every hour to make sure the animals were alright. Wow what a job.

This story is mainly about how great Seagoing Cowgirls are and what they bring to other countries. They transported animals to other countries who didn't have food or transportation. Seagoing Cowgirls were true heroines, they cared for animals and people. They had kind hearts for both of them.      ","

M-F299,"Luke's point of veiw if you wanna join or participate the saegoing cowgirls is she said it was an opportunity of a lifetime, so you get to do it once. Another reason that Luke thought you should join or partcipate is you can take care of horses,young cows,and mules that are being shipped overseas. You also get to feeed the horses.When you have time on the ship you can play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games to pass the time. It even opens up the world for you to discover.

When Luke was discovering the world she was grateful for the opportunity and it also made her aware of people of other countries and their needs. Luke also made 16 trips around the Alantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 2 times to help people who were affected by World War ll. Another reason to join the Seagoing cowgirls program is you can see the people in needs who got their houses destroyed in World War ll. When Luke was in the Seagoing Cowgirls program she visited many unique places like New Orleans,Greece,Europe,China and she also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy and also toured a excavated castle in Crete.

You should be careful while being a watchman in the dark because Luke slid on a slippery ladder on her backside. A small strip oh metal stopped her slide from flying overboard. She was happy to be alive but she couldn't work for a couple days of her cracked ribs. Also Luke travled on the Charles w. Wooster and as heading to Greece. It will take 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean. Also what she did on the ship is she cleaned stalls which you might have to do.The last thing she did was help out in the kitchen. You have to help cook in the kitchen.","

M-F300,"Some resones to join the program are that you can help people after they have had a hard time. The situation from the text is after World War ll there was alot of destruction in Europe. So Luke went over to Europe to help people get thier lives back. Being a Seagoing Cowgirl wasn't all just work you also got to travle the world and see cool places. She said that she and other people on the boat had fun on the way back.

She said that she saw some cool places, and did cool thing, like seeing the Panama Canal or go on a gandola ride in Veince, Italy. Whe the stalls were emty ,she said, that alot of gals on the ship would play games to make the time pass. Some of the games that she had mentoined were baseball, volleyball, table tennis, and many others. They helped pass the time by playing games, is what she said.

I think that she made it sound very appealing to be a Seagoing Cowgirl it definetily had it's up's an down's. Like cleaning the stals would be a down, and a up would be playing games. Also being able to go see and do things in other parts of the world.        ","
